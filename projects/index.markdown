Most of my projects can be found at [BitBucket][1]. More can be found at [GitHub][2].

At work, I build [The ROSS System][3], most notably the backend and staff portal: [myROSS][4].

I also have a few other sites I have developed: [jaquiehagan][6] and [bing boy][7]. (Note that these were designed by [jaquiehagan][6]: I just built the HTML/CSS/JS). The last one of these is now maintained by someone else: it's very likely to have lots of changes since I made it.
