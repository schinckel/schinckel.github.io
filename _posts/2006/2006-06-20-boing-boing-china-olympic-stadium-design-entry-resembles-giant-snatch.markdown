[Boing Boing: China Olympic stadium design entry resembles giant snatch?][1] ![Chinese Stadium][2] This is kind of amusing, but even more so when I think back to a furore that erupted in my early days of University, shortly after the State Bank of South Australia fiasco that resulted in the bank being rebranded as BankSA. Along with the name change came a new logo: ![BankSA Logo][3] Some wags from one of the student newspapers - it may have been _on dit_, the Adelaide Uni newspaper, but I seem to recall it being _entropy_, the UniSA paper - decided that it looked decidedly snatch-like, and called it CuntSA. Needless to say, it didn't go down too well.
