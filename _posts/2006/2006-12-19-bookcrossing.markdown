I've heard of BookCrossing.com - lost of people have. The idea is that you find a book somewhere, read it, and leave it somewhere else. Until tonight, however, I'd never actually come across any BookCrossing books. I suppose I could have just printed out the stuff for one of my own books, but I've never been one to give books away. I like keeping them. So, the book I found tonight is Tall Poppies: Successful Australian women talk to Susan Mitchell. Not exactly standard fare for what I normally read, but I'll give it a whirl. It was first registered by crossword, in Adelaide, SA. I might have to leave it somewhere a little more exotic. Perhaps in Hamilton.
