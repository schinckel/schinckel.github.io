The latest National Interest podcast had a segment on Carboard Coffins. These are an environmentally friendly replacement for regular coffins, and interestingly both interviewees were from Adelaide. I realised, at the end of the story, that I knew the John Smith that was referrred to as having been buried/cremated (I missed this bit) in a cardboard coffin. He was a lecturer we had at Uni, who died a couple of years ago from cancer. John taught us an Energy Systems class, where we studied a heap of environmentally sensitive topics, such as sustainable housing, and other bits like that. Pete, a good friend of mine had a bit more to do with him after Uni finished. Hi Pete.
