I've borrowed a digital SLR from my work, and taken a couple of hundred photos with it already. I really like being able to choose my shutter speed, although the light was too low for me to get the speeds I needed tonight at touch. Anyway, it's really brought home to me how slow iPhoto is. I just don't think I'll be able to use it any more. I might continue to use the file structure, or at least part of it. Or perhaps I'll just save images into folders that are the equivalent of my iPhoto albums, and then use spotlight indexing to find photos. It doesn't seem to do that good a job of working from EXIF data, perhaps I'll need to write a spotlight extension, that grabs that data and stores it in the index.
