I've just purchased, and started using a Logitech USB Optical mouse. It was pretty cheap, only AU$20, and I've wanted a scroll mouse for the iMac forever... So, I installed it, and downloaded the Logitech driver, to see if I could configure it to make it a bit better. And it looks like I can - there is an option to accelerate the scroll, so that scrolling faster scrolls more than the same distance slower. Then I looked in the readme: 

> **Q:** My LCC settings are gone after switching user with "Fast User Switching", what happened?
> 
> **A:** LCC does not support "Fast User Switching". In order to enjoy the different LCC configurations for multiple users, one has to log out and log in the system instead of using "Fast User Switching". To log out and log in the system: 
> 
>   * Select Apple Menu on the upper left corner.
>   * Select "Log Out".
>   * Click "Log Out" button when prompted.
>   * Select your log-in name or type in the log-in name. Then, enter your password.
>   * Click "Log In".

What is this crap? Are you that lazy that you didn't bother building some sort of support for FUS into the system? Don't you think that anyone actually uses FUS? Uninstall. Very nearly take it back to the store to return it (doesn't do what it says, isn't fully supported under OS X), before deciding that that's not worth the effort, and I was already pretty happy with how it works without the extra features! Still, angry with Logitech.
