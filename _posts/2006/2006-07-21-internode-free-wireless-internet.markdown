I've had my Mum's laptop for the last little while, as I prepare a multimedia display for my Grandfather's 80th birthday party, and I happened to have it with me today as I stopped for a cup of coffee in Illy on King William Road, Hyde Park. When I turned it on, it complained about not being able to find it's normal networks, so I looked at what networks were available. One of the unsecured networks is Internode, who apparently provide free wireless hotspots around the CBD and inner suburbs. It is limited to web pages only, and apparently session limits apply. So no monster 8 hour WoW sessions over wireless, but that's a moot point anyway, as this laptop doesn't seem to have the guts to run it...
