One site I am responsible for is that of my Touch club, [Central Scorpions][1]. I did have a blog set up, but have migrated to the system my association uses for results and fixtures. I set up a lovely domain name, and using stealth forwarding, I had that stay in the address bar. We really only want people to visit via the main page, anyway, so that doesn't raise issues of not being able to bookmark a specific page. However, using IE (Win), if I have a stealth forwarding setup, the site runs v.e.r.y...s.l.o.w. Under Firefox (Mac) it's fine, and if I use a standard redirect, this is fine too. So, stealth forwarding must do something strange, that IE doesn't like in conjunction with the js for the rollovers, I think. It may have something to do with the way it's set up as a frame, I'm not sure.
