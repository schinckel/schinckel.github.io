I missed the first season of the new Battlestar Galactica. Something to do with it being on late at night, during _WoW_time, and not always being on at the same time every week. I was a big fan as a kid of the original series (I even have BSG wallpaper in my room at my parents' house!), so I was looking forward to the new series. And I wasn't disappointed. From the first moment, BSG was fantastic. I was forced, by the ineptitude of the Channel 9 programmers, to download the first series via BitTorrent - or rather, have a friend who had already done so burn me a copy. Season 2, which is currently being shown, and which, since it wasn't advertised, I missed the first couple of episodes, fell into the same boat. Download the lot of them, at least that way I get to see it in the right order. And now, with Nine still showing season 2, while #3 is on the US, I've had to revert to BT again. Man is this season good. I disliked the ending of the last season - it seemed to change character way too much in the way it was set up for the occupation. I watched the Webisodes regardless, and didn't mind them. And then Season 3. I'm still a couple of episodes behind the US, but I'm hooked again. The way this series, unlike virtually every other program on television ever, isn't afraid to do a good bit of character development, and then, suddenly, kill off the characters. Just like that. (Although, just quietly, I'm still not convinced the one they killed in Episode 4 isn't a Cylon.) They could have padded out the Resistance a bit more - I'd like to think I'm not spoiling too much by saying they got off the planet a little to easily, but hey, it was ballsy. And sacrificing a BattleStar - I'm not sure that was such a good idea, either. Surely they could have managed to come up with a way to jump away at the last minute. Or did they...? And the mind games the Cylons manage to play with each of the characters. I love it.
