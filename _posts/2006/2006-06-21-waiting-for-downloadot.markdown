A pathetic attempt at making a joke: _cf._ [Waiting for Godot][1]; I'm currenlty waiting for the WoW 1.11 update to finish downloading. I thought I had grabbed all the files in advance, but apparently there was another 20Mb or so that hadn't been distributed yet. So, I wait again. 92%, and counting.
