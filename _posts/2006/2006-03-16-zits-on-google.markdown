How true: ![][1] Actually, the main reason I'm posting this is to comment on the Washington Post's method of preventing you stealing the images displayed in comments. It's actually quite clever. It checks the refererring page (where the `<img src=“”>` code is), and allows or rejects the request according to this. Of course, the easy way to get around it: take a screenshot. The harder way: find the image file in your cache. Search your computer for all files modified in the last 5 minutes just after loading the web page for the first time. You'll need some kind of tool to examine the data in files, and be able to rename files to add the right extension.
