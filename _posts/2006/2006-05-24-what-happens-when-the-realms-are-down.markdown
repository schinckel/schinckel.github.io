Scheduled downtime tonight on my WoW server - so rather than do anything else, I created a spreadsheet showing costs and potential profits for various items my characters can make. So now, I know the lowest price I can sell stuff for, and what items are the most profitable. And, it's not always the more expensive items that are, percentage-wise, the most profitable. But, you do need to make and sell less of them. Which means you aren't relying on 100 people to all be wanting a particular item, just maybe one or two. However, it has given me a lot of ideas about where to spend time in terms of manufacturing ocer the next little while. And, I'm not making this data available, for a couple of very good reasons. I worked very hard to input the data, and I don't want anyone knowing what my profit margins are like, and undercutting me, or anything like that...
