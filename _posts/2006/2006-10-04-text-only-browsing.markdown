I've had to use a text-only browser over the recent days, since Internet Sharing is being screwed up by my router. I could, I suppose plug my switch back into the network, and disconnect the router, but then I have to worry about IP addresses again, since the router is also the DHCP server. Anyway, it's been an interesting exercise. Some sites are well designed, and using them in links is possible, easy even. This site, for instance, shows up very well in links, and is easy to navigate around in. Credit where it is due, this is mainly due to Patricia, and the Wordpress team. The backend for instance is similarly easy to navigate around. Gmail is satisfactory. It whinges about missing JavaScript, but still seems to work. Not sure if the emails I have been sending have been working, but we'll find out. Actually, I'll take that back. It doesn't seem to send emails properly. Dammit. Whirlpool and WildIT do not work very well at all. Sure, you can view stuff, but you cannot log in properly, which prevents you from seeing the really important data, and adding your own comments. Yellow Pages seems to work okay, as long as you don't mind only looking at the first page of results. Well, hopefully my ADSL churn will come through in the next couple of days, as I'm sick of it already.
