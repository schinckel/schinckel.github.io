Well, the title sums it up. There doesn't seem to be a way to store a list of items in a Microsoft Access database. For instance, I have an item that may belong on several categories, but I can't just have a LIST datatype, and have a list stored in here. Instead, I'll have to have yet another table that has relationships, which further complicates the database. And makes creating a form for entering data more difficult.
