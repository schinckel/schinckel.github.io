[\[Playlist\] Mobster][1]

> For those of you unfamiliar with the application, Mobster acts as a XSPF content resolver to build playlists out of the local music library. This means that if you get a XSPF with filled out metadata (), Mobster will look through your local iTunes library and recreate the playlist with any of the songs you have available.

Basically, XPSF is a playlist file that doesn't store the track's location, only title, artist and album. Thus, you can share playlists, and people that have (some or all of) the tracks can then listen to the playlist. I have done some exports of playlists from iTunes, and it is pretty good at matching them up if you re-import the playlist, so I'm not that sure this is that worthwhile.
