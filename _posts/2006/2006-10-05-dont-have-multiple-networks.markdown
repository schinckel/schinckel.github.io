I've had my ADSL reconnected, and was having some issues on my PC only. I didn't realise they weren't affecting the Mac, until I wandered around and tried it, and the stuff worked properly first time. It seems there were some issues with having a Firewire network and the Ethernet network (only one of which is actually connected to the internet). I'm not sure exactly what the story was, but it was timing out on requests, and occasionally working. Disabling the Firewire interface has fixed it all up. So, don't have two overlapping networks, as Windows can't figure out where requests need to go...
