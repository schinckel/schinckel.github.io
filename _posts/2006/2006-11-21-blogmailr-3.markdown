There has been some discussion about how [Blogsome][1] doesn't allow Email posting, and now a new service has stepped in to fill the gap.  
  
[Blogmailr][2] is a free service that allows you to send an email to a predetermined address (like [r7873hud@blogmailr.com ][3]), and it will automagically appear as an entry on your blog.  
  
You'll need to visit Blogmailr first, and register.  I created a new user in my blog (be sure to promote it to a level that can post, ie > 0), so that if things go bad, I can easily remove posts, and it can't remove anything I have posted from my proper account.  
  
You can also add categories, and styling to the post.  Like I have to this one.  
  
Thanks to [Micah][4] for this find.   
  
  
Update: I've not used Blogmailr since this date, and have removed the user to which it was attached...
