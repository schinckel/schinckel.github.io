I've created a [Popular Posts][1] page, so I can have a limited number of popular posts in the sidebar, and the title of the box they appear in linking to a page with all of the popular posts. I'll do the same with [Recent Posts][2], since this will be a smaller list than [Archives][3]. Basically, it will be a list of the last 25 posts, rather than a list of all of them, or the complete text of any posts. I've just had another thought: for search pages, I could do some fancy stuff with testing the URL for '`/search/`', and then generating a search from the remainder. Instead of having to wait for Rewrite Rules to be implemented. Hmm, interesting. 

   [1]: /popular-posts/
   [2]: /recent-posts/
   [3]: /archives/
