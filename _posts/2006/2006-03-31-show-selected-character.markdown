I often use Apple's Character Palette - it allows for the insertion of every character from every font into the current document. You can open it by choosing _Show Character Palette_ from the **Input Menu**. It usually shows the flag of your country, although you may need to activate it using the **International Preference Pane**. ![][1] I won't go into how to use it, but I will talk about the little utility menu down in the bottom left. ![][2] That's right, you can select a character, and get it shown in the Character Palette. It doesn't work in every application - FireFox is an example, but it's possible to copy and paste from these applications into one that does work: SubEthaEdit for example. Finally, I can replace the CJK Unicode characters in my Template with their `&#x0b5d` (hex) equivalent: 
    
    &#x8001;&#x864e;&#x6cb9;&#x6f06;
