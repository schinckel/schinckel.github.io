This weekend was the SAPSASA Touch Trials, which are for boys and girls aged 12 and under. Since I have a vested interest in making sure the best group of 12s girls gets selected as possible, being that I get them when they turn 13, I tend to come out and help run/select at these trials. This year's bunch of 10, 11 and 12 year-olds was astounding. It really seems like our state development programs are starting to work out. Each year we seem to have a better group of kids than the years before. Even though there were only just over the 14 that each team takes away, this is better than in recent years where we have had to find extra players. And almost without exception, all of the kids trialling know the rules better than the first group of 15s I took away did. Mind you, those girls are now all over 18, and some of them have played State Women's Open, and Crusaders 20s, so not taking anything away from all of them. I wound up running the grids on both days, and helping with the selection of the girls team. I really enjoy working with kids that age, but I think I could only handle so much of it before I tired of the young-ness of them. If you know what I mean.
