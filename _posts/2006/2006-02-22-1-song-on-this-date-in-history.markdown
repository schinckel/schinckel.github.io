[#1 Song on This Date in History][1] This is cool: you plug in your birthday, or any other day, and it tells you what the #1 songs were on that day, back until about 1940. On the day I was born: 

_December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)_ by **The Four Seasons**

On Jaq's day of birth: 

_Disco Lady_ by **Johnnie Taylor**

At least I've heard of my birth-song!
