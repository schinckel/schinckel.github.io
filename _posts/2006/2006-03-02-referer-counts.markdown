I'm just going to quickly stroke my own ego a little bit. Apologies. In my Popular Posts list, I have about 1800 page reads of various items, but only stuff that is viewed as a single page is recorded here. Thus, hits on the main site page, or a category index page, or even a daily page with only one post on it, would not count as a view. I assume that this value refers to the past month, as it doesn't seem to increase forever. If I look at my referer list for the past month, I see there have been just over 9000 page views on my site. This includes all page views, such as those discussed above that are not counted. That means 7000 views are either index page views, or more interestingly, _Long Tail _posts. That is, posts that are not in the top band of popular posts.
