Everyone probably knows this, as it's on the iTunes Music Store already, but you can download partial episodes of _Thank God You're Here_ via podcast. Legally, apparently. Mind you, the first few lines Anh Do's performance were okay, but it went downhill from there. Apparently this is the best they could come up with. I thought it were crap. And it still had the advertisements from Hungry Jacks in it... Unsubscribe

Bright Side of The Road • "The Best Of Van Morrison" • [Van Morrison][1]

And, I've got to fix my iTunes insert code so it puts the rating as a number of stars... I might use a script rather than the normal ecto button.
