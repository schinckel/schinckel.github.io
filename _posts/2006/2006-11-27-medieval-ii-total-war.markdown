I've started playing this game, but have hit some hardware or software issues. I keep getting system crashes, and Windows crash reporter isn't much help. I think it's my graphics driver, and I'm downloading an update. In the meantime it seems to have killed my Direct X installation too, so I've updated that. Since I installed, I haven't been able to run WoW either, so I hope that's just a temporary thing since the last crash, not a fuckup of the Direct X installation. Update: It gets better. Checkout this error when I try to run AOE III demo: ![][1] Apparently, my GeForce has no memory.
