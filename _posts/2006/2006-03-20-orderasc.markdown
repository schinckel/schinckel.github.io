A Blogsome user wanted to use the URL switch `?order=asc` to get an ascending list of posts by date. I suggested it would't work, but they tried it in the form: [http://schinckel.net/category&order=asc][1] And it worked! It only seems to work for category pages, although I think the above URL will actually catch every post, as each post lives in at least one place within the /category hierarchy. This opens up huge opportunities to use other URL switches to get other effects under Blogsome. I'm off to the [Wordpress Codex][2], to see what else I can use!
