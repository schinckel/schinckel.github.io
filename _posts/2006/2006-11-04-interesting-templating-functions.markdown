Every now and then, I have cause to go through the Blogsome source code, and each time I come across what seem like interesting functions. Today, I noticed: 

  * get_category_parents
  * get_category_children
  * get_linksbyname
  * get_autotoggle
  * get_lastpostdate, get_lastpostmodified
  * get_currentuserinfo
  * query_posts
  * get_cat_ID

Some of these I don't yet know what they do, but at least three are _very_ interesting for doing stuff I've been working on for a while.
