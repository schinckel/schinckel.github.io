I bought an extra Gig of Ram today - I thought I already had a gigabyte in my PC, but I only had 512 Mb. Upping the Ram makes World of Warcraft run smoothly, even in Ironforge, a busy city where I get crappy FPS. I've also been able to increase some of the detail settings without too noticeable dip in performance. But by far the best outcome is that I can switch between WoW and Firefox without having to wait ten or twenty seconds for it to catch up...
