Well, it hardly seems like a year since the last 15s trials, but it must be. Last weekend was the date, and over the Saturday and Sunday, we had a total of 33 girls trial. What was excellent again this year was the general standard of the girls. Virtually all of them had very good ball skills, and most were quite athletic. It was, as I always seem to be saying in my letters out to candidates, very hard to select a team from a pool of talent like this. Having said that, we've selected what we deemed to be the 21 best girls from the weekend, and in about a month I'll be holding further trials, over a couple of weekends. Following that, there will be a selection of 14 girls to be in the final team, and then training begins in earnest. And then, at the end of October, it's off to Perth for a week.
