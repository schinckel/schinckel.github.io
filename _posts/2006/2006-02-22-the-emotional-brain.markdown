[ABC][1] [Radio National][2]'s [All in the Mind][3] recently broadcast a series of four programs entitled "The Emotional Brain." Unfortunately, I missed the first two episodes, and they've since disappeared from the website, or rather, the MP3s have. 

  * [The Emotional Brain, Part 1: Sexual Desire][4]
  * [The Emotional Brain, Part 2: Anger][5]
  * [The Emotional Brain, Part 3: Jealousy][6]
  * [The Emotional Brain, Part 4: Joy][7]

I wouldn't mind getting hold of the missing two episodes, if anyone has them floating around on their hard disk still... I'll repeat my mantra that the ABC should keep all of it's programs available online, for eternity. Storage is cheap.
