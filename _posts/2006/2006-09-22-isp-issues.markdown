Well, I can't get onto my less-than-one-month-old ADSL connection, since Veridas, the upstream ISP for Opti has apparently gone belly-up. The bad thing about this is that it also affects some files I was hosting there (and, worse, the files Jaq had set up for her web site). I can't even set up a replacement web site, as the files are only on my home computer, and I have no access from home. Not even dialup.
