I received another strange Spam message this morning - the subject alone got my attention: 

> I am Dislexic of Borg. Resistance is Futile. Prepare to have your ass laminated

_Dyslexic_: spelled wrong. But that's one of the ironies of the word itself. Then, there was an image that didn't exist, followed by a poorly transcripted excerpt from Anna Karenin: 

> "self-interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did work for it." "No!" Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; "the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter. **There **self-interest did come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all decent people among us. But to be a town **councilor **and discuss how many dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which I don't live--to serve on a jury and try a peasant who's stolen a flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, 'Do you admit, prisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?' 'Eh?'" Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was all to the point. But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.

I say poorly transcripted, as there are at least two spelling errors here, bolded above - and I'm not sure that _flitch_ is a real word either. There is an attachment, which appears to be an `image/gif`, but I can't view it. I'm not sure if it's a virus attached to appear like an image - if it is it's a very small executable - or some sort of advertising Spam. But there are no links in there, and I can't figure out what they are selling, other than perhaps poor copies of famous Russian novels. There are a couple of headers worth noting: `From: "allisyn breanne" <flimflammed@cdg.org> X-Mailer: The Bat! (v3.0.0.9) Professional` I wouldn't put much strength in the first one being legit, but the second one might be the name of a Spammer client. However, the only reference I can find to it in a very quick Google search is a list of serial numbers for it. That's ironic, a cracked serial number for a spamming email client...
