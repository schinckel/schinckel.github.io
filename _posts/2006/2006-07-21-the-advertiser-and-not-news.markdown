I don't understand who makes the decisions as to what gets into the newspaper in the city in which I live. For instance, on page 4 today: 

> **Cigarettes sold, no questions asked.** Yesterday, Megan Wilsdon, of North Adelaide, was able to buy a packet of cigarettes from a city convenience store, despite having only recently turned 18.

So, what is the issue? The girl is over 18, hence is allowed to buy cigarettes. Get some real news.
