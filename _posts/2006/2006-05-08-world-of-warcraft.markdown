Well, I've pretty much spent every spare minute I've had in the past week or so playing [WoW][1]. It's a kind of addictive game, to say the least. I've managed to get my main character up to Level 25, with a bit of help from _Blasta_. For those of you who don't know what World of Warcraft is, it's a Massively Multiplayer Online RolePlaying Game (or MMORPG), where basically you run around killing monsters, collecting loot and trading with other players. The thing that sets it apart from other video games is that you play with (and against) real people in real time. For instance, I have a group of friends who live in Melbourne, and they have started a Guild, of which I am a member. They often adventure together, and at times I join in. I have also teamed up with people from around the world, most notably a couple of Canadians. There are a variety of races and classes that one can play as in the world of Azeroth, which anyone who has played any of the Warcraft series may remember. They are largely very similar to the classes and races one might see in Dungeons & Dragons, or many other fantasy settings: Elves, Dwarves Gnomes and Humans; versus Orcs, Trolls, Tauren (Minotaurs) and Undead. Players can be Warriors, Mages, Paladins, Priests, Shamen, Hunters, Warlocks, Rogues and Druids. The game is more than just hack-n-slash, as there is a robust economy, where people can trade found items, but also develop skills in manufacture, and create their own products. For instance, my character has Leatherworking skills, and can create various types of leather armour, and I can sell these to other players through a server-wide auction house. Other people have specialised in manufacture of metal armour, weapons or magical items. If you happen to be on the _Hyjal _server, then give _Ibukan _a hello, and we can hook up and kill some baddies together.
