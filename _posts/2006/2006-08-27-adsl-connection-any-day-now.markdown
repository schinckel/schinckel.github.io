Well, I've signed up for ADSL access with Optimum Internet, and it's due to be connected on the 29th August. The connection seems to be there already when I plug my modem in, but I can't get it to actually connect properly. I'm not sure if that is because I don't have all of the settings correct, which I think I have set up, or if it just hasn't been activated properly yet. 15Gb/month for $32.50, on a 256k plan. Unless I'm mistaken, 256k means 256 kilobits per second, which roughly equates to 32 kilobytes per second. That would indicate around 32 sec/meg, or 1.875 Megabytes/sec. Assuming this (best case scenario), that means it would take around 133 hours to download 15Gb. That's about 5.5 days. So, maxed out, it should take me about 1 week to reach my quota.
