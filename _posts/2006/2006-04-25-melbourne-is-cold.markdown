Just spent four full days in Melbourne. It was cold. Went over there to catch up with some old school friends of mine, whose birthdays parties we'd missed in the past 12 or so months. Was drunk pretty much non-stop for three days. Used to be able to do that without blinking. Have to blink now. Bought World of Warcraft after having a bit of a play over there. So, you may never hear from me again, apparentlyâ€¦ Oh, and this one, from [xkcd.com][1] is for Wayne: ![][2]
