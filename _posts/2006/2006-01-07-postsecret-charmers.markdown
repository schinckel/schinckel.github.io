![][1] Hey tiger, you are the reason the rest of us have to pay such exhorbiant insurance prices! ![][2] I sometimes kind of feel this way. If _I_ can do something, it can't be too hard, can it? ![][3] I'm a bit the other way. I loose pens every day. ![][4] Another year, another wasted year. ![][5] The line I like best is from Diamonds Are Forever, where 007 meets a girl, and she goes to get changed, and comes back with a different colour hair. He comments, and she asks him which he prefers. His response: 

> I don't mind. As long as the collars and cuffs match.

I never understood that as a child. ![][6] I thought about this today when shopping. I saw a photo frame, and thought about people who buy a photo frame, and keep the picture that's in there, as it's better than anything they could replace it with.
