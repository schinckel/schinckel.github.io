A track just came onto my iTunes via Party Shuffle. It's one I haven't heard for a while, but reminded me of the time we went to see this band live. Especially notable, as it was at the Speigeltent, during the Adelaide Fringe Festival some years back, and it's that time of the year again. It was, I believe, just before Derek left Adelaide for the big smoke of Sydney. Well, Wollongong, anyway. He did work in Sydney...  Anyway, we went to see this band, on my birthday, and were the only customers there. That's right, the whole venue was empty, and because of us, they had to perform. And there were good! I enjoyed them, and bought a CD. It's about the only time I've ever bought a CD right after going to a gig. Maybe I felt a little sorry for them, maybe I didn't. So, I just switched over to iTunes to see when the CD was released: 1999. That means it was probably 2000 when we went to see them. Six years ago. Has it been that long since Derek left? This is one of my favourite of the tracks on the album: 

[Wish][1] • [Honey][2] • [Honey][3] ★★★★

> More than anything, I wish that you were here; To laugh at all my fears; To hold me in your arms, and laugh at all my shame; And to love me still. But you're gone and I hold my head down, And I wonder where you are; And I see you when I'm sleeping, babe; I Wish I'd Loved You, I Wish I'd Loved You, I Wish I'd Loved You More.

Here are some random links I found on Google about them: [DM3, Honey @ Mojo's Bar, September 25, 1999][4] [Honey, Self-title album Review][5] (This one I had to scroll back up a bit from the anchor point to read it, the link seems a bit broken.) I wonder if they are still together/performing/recording.
