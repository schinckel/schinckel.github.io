We ordered a heap of environmentally friendly wood oil, to do the floor with when we finally get around to it, and it came with a **Free Magazine!** Unfortunately, it contains a whole lot of crap about various things that are total rubbish, not the least being homeopathy. I'm not even going to detail how much crap it is, but just point you instead towards: [Homeopathy: The Ultimate Fake][1]. I will put a couple of quotes from the articles about Homeopathy in there, however. 

> Homeopathic medicines are considered safe and free from serious adverse reactions since they are highly diluted.

So highly diluted, in fact, that to be sure to get even one molecule of the original chemical, you would need to take around 2 billions times the homeopathic medicine's dose (at 30X). 

> The cost of consultations will depend on their duration, with inital consultations varying between $60 to $120.

For someone to give you a glass of water. Even if it is bottled water, it still ain't worth _that_ much. As Barrett mentions in the linked article, Homeopathy is indistinguishable in effects from a placebo, _because that is exactly what it is_. A very complicated, expensive placebo. 

> Most major health funds provide cover for homeopathic treatment.

No wonder health insurance is so fucking expensive. I hope my insurer doesn't! I won't be reading any other articles in _Living Now_. Straight to the recycling bin. Or maybe I'll shred it so my local rubbish molester doesn't get the wrong ideas about stuff.
