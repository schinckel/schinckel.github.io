Thanks to Andy at [TouchSA][1], I've come across a couple of rather cool, funny things on the interblags. They are all related, but I'll go through all of them. They all relate to that funniest of television chefs: the Swedish Chef from the Muppet Show. 

  * The first is the [Firefox ][2]extension that translates the web content into [Bork Bork Bork][3].
  * Secondly, Google has [Bork, bork, bork][4] as one of it's languages, so you can have it in that language whenever you search. Note that this is for the Google pages only, not the search results themselves.
  * Finally, I found a tool that converts any entered text into Bork Bork Bork. ([Swedish Chef!][5])
