John Gruber, over on [Daring Fireball][1], has posted about the name change of Lightroom to Adobe Lightroom, in [Brand New][2], and seems to have hit the nail on the head with the discussion about rebranding and brand integrity. He's also spoken about cross-platform applications, and how Adobe are the only real software maker that builds true single-source based applications that run on multiple OSes. I would have agreed with him, except that he talks about how Lightroom is built using Lua as a scripting language. There is at least one other cross-platform application, also built with Lua, that is updated regularly, is the same on Mac and PC, and even “shares the same manual”. That application is, of course, World of Warcraft. Blizzard, along with (some) other game makers, have a long history of releasing Mac and PC versions of their software. I assume the source code for these two is largely the same, as they continue to update it on a monthly or so schedule, and a significant proportion of the update code is the same on both platforms. Granted, Blizzard are very different to most other game development houses, in that they do write Mac versions of their software. And they don't have to write code that uses the GUI hooks, in that they have their own UI. But, it's still (almost certainly) the same codebase, nonetheless. Well, I'm hung over, and I need a Chicken Yiros.
