Ben Elton is pretty fantastic. He wrote for _The Young Ones_, and _Blackadder_, and has since written several books, most of which are pretty good. His latest is _The First Casualty_, a historical fiction (?) piece set during the Great War. I was gripped, and read it in one sitting. No comedy here, guys, but well worth the effort. The guts of the story: in 1917, a war hero and poet is killed, not in action, but while recuperating after being injured, and shellshocked. A disgraced police officer, who was sent to jail for refusing to fight in the war (not a conchie, as his grounds were "purely intellectual") is 'recruited' to find the identity of the killer.
