Within the multiverse that is WoW (there are different servers, called _realms_, which are totally isolated from one another) when a character reaches level 40 they are eligible for a mount. This is an expensive exercise, at around 90 gold for training and purchase, but is well worth it, as is allows for a faster ground speed. Since Ibukan is a Night Elf, she only has access (at least at this stage) to one type of mount, a Nightsaber. I chose for her the striped, rather than the spotted version. I will post a screenshot, just so everyone can see how cool she looks on it...
