My computer decided that Daylight Savings was supposed to end last night (or rather, this morning), when in actuality it doesn't end until next Sunday morning. I'm not sure if this is because of the Commonwealth Games, or whether it was just programmed in wrong. Apparently this affects Windows, too.
