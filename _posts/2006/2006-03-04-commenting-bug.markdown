I'm not sure, but I think my script is doing something that stops comments going through the first time you submit them. I've only noticed it on my blog: except I just noticed it on another blog when I tried to comment. When I repeated the comment, it worked fine. Also, I think when I've already commented and then add another comment during the same session, it all works fine. Maybe that's why I'm not getting too many comments anymore. Either that, or I'm just not posting stuff that's interesting enough.
