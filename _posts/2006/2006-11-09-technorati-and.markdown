... blogs with multiple domain names. This blog has a couple of different domain names by which it can be accessed. I would prefer it all to be [schinckel.net][1], but it's not possible to have [Blogsome][2] work properly if it thinks that is the domain name. I've got it pretty close (most of the links, for instance, point to a [schinckel.net][1] location), but since it is a multiple user system, and the way it works out which database the data should be gathered from, the domain name must end with `blogsome.com`. So, in one sense future-proofing myself (if Blogsome shut down, I would simply repost all of the data onto a new system, and just point [schinckel.net][1] there), and another because it's a shorter domain, I want links to go to there instead. But, there is one bad side-effect. I use technorati for seeing incoming links, but with the setting change I talked about above, it only now picks up links coming to [schinckel.net][1], not [schinckel.net][1], which isn't really good enough. Since I get more links coming to the latter than the former. So my dashboard doesn't get to see most of the links I'm really interested in...
