[Change icon color with CSS - CSS Insider][1] This is actually a very cool idea: it allows for very simple replacement of image background colours. The images are actually transparent background, with white detail, and you just place them over a div-tag with the right background/shape, and away you go. You can then very easily change the colour/shape, all with CSS, allowing for site-wide design changes very simply. Plus, they are smaller than using images with colours, and you only need to have one version but can have different colours, without a server hit for changes in colour.
