I've borrowed a laptop from work, and a Wireless Access Point device, so now I can do stuff from my bedroom late at night, like I am this. However, just recently I have come across some sort of strange behaviour. Sometimes, but not all of the time, MacOS's Internet Sharing feature seems to get turned off. Which means I need to get access to the machine and restart it. Not much fun when I'm all toasty warm in bed, and the Mac is in the cold, cold study. So, I've done a little bit of research. I might be able to restart it using: `$ sudo /usr/libexec/InternetSharing` I'll try that next time it drops out... but I'd rather have a better fix.
