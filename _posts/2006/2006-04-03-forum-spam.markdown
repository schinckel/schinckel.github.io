There's a thread in the [Blogsome Forums][1] called "Sites of the Week", which has a list of [Blogsome][2] blogs that were at one stage or another selected by the admins, and I noticed a new post in that thread today: ![][3] I figure that if you want to Spam forums, you should at least get the code right so it doesn't look quite so shite. I also figured that in this thread, any link to a non-blogsome site shouldn't really be there.
