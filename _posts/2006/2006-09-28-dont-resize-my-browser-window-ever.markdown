I use a banking site, which thankfully, now supports Firefox. And, supposedly to assist security, there is something like a five minute timeout, which logs you out of the system if you don't have any interaction with the server. This is bad enough: often I'm getting data out of my bank account, and check an email, or get an IM, and when I go back to the bank site, I'm logged out. But, what's even worse is that when I get logged out, it resizes the browser window to the full size of the screen. I run in 1680x1050, and a significant section of my screen is set aside for status monitors of a sort. And, I've got my browser window exactly the size I want it to be. So, it annoys the hell out of me to have to resize it, just because some idiot coded in a crappy line into their javascript. I wonder if I could use a GreaseMonkey filter to stop it happening?
