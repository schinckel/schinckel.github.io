[Call Me Fishmeal.: This Post is Microsoft Enhanced (TM).][1]

> But, hey, I'm fine with having to come home before my favorite shows and unschedule them and then reschedule them so my DVR will suddenly decide it's OK to record them again. I like to think of it as sort of rotating the tires; I keep the show schedule fresh. It's amazing how much less TV you'll watch when you have to reschedule everything every week, too. Besides, it's not like the POINT of having a DVR is you DON'T have to be there to start each recording manually. And this is first-generation technology, right? Right? I mean, there's NEVER been any other brands of DVRs, right? Microsoft invented this shit, no? And enhanced it?

Wil gets stuck into his DVR and it's foibles. Made me chuckle, _'cause I don't know him_. (With thanks to Homer J.) But seriously, I think he's got a point.
