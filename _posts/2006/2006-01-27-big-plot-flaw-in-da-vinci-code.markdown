I'm most of the way through the abridged version of _the Da Vinci Code_, as read by Jeff Harding. I think I've come across a Big Plot Flawâ„¢, but be aware that this post contains a plot spoiler. 

Now, gazing up at the spires of Rosslyn... • [Dan Brown][1] • [The Da Vinci Code][2]

Apparently, _Teabing_ is _The Teacher_. He seems to have been the driving force behind the murder of the Grand Master, and the Senechals. However, there are two issues here: how did he get out of the back of the car, and how come Remy did not recognise him at their meetings? Or maybe I'm missing something here? Time to Google thisâ€¦ • Yup. Wikipedia shows that Teabing is the Teacher. But no mention of how he got out of the back of the car, nor how Remy did not recognise him. In fact, it says they are in cahoots. Yet Remy was approached by the Teacher to spy on Teabing. I don't get thisâ€¦perhaps this is dealt with better in the full text.
