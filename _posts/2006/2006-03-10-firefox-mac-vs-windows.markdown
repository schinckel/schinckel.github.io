I've got some serious JavaScript_age_ going on with my site: I sometimes wonder if it's too much. One thing I have noticed is that on my iMac I get occasional "_There is a script taking a long time to finish. **Continue**/**Stop Script**_" errors, but never see these on the PC. I also don't see them under IE/Win, the platform I am forced to use at work. ![][1] I also get errors with Camino, but I'm not sure about Safari. I've gone into [about:config][2], and changed _dom.max_script_run_time_ from the default of `5` to `20`, just to see if that makes a difference.
