When I try to Assess student work using Scholaris, I come across the following error: ![][1]

> Class: Assessment Function: GetAssessmentVerbages(ByVal FrameworkID As String, ByVal SchoolID As String) As DataTable 
> 
> \* \* \*
> 
> Current function cannot be executed due to the following reason: \*FrameworkID is empty Please take a screen shot of this error message and send it to support@solutionsit.com.au 
> 
> \* \* \*

It then doesn't display the student work that was submitted, and I can't mark it, or return it to the student. I get several other functions giving the same error, two on the way in, and three on the way out. Very annoying, as it means I can't complete the full cycle of assessment using this tool, which means I've hit the limits of it's usefulness for now.
