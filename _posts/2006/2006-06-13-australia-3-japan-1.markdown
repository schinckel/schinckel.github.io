Well, that's one for the record books. The fastest three-goal streak in World Cup Final history, and the first time the Socceroos have scored in the WCF. And I missed it. Bloody WoW! But, it's downtime tonight, so I'll be able to watch whatever games are on. Not quite the same without some sort of emotional involvement, though, is it? I do think it's a little early for the celebrations that have erupted on the various Aussie football (but not as you know it) sites. From AAP: 

> Australia has arrived at the World Cup ball, not as one of the ugly sisters but as a stunning Cinderella set to wow them on the dance floor. And a startled world has sat up to take notice.

What I heard was that Japan's defense was a bit crap. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but it's early to be breaking out the really good champagne. Unless, you just want to make sure you actually get the good stuff used. I'll be saying "tops" if we manage to get past the Group games. But, in the meantime, I'll jump onto the bandwagon. Why not?
