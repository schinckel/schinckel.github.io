I've upgraded my SpeedTouch modem from the Home version, to the Pro version. To get better web access tools, I then upgraded it to the 510 firmware. However, I then had to set my PC's IP address back to one in the 10.0.0.X range, as the modem had decided not to get an IP address from the DHCP server on my network. Hopefully that has been fixed now... I'm not sure that I'll keep the upgrade in place. Whilst it allows for easer NA(P)T translations, it doesn't seem to have some other features. I'm not sure if I'll need them or not, but it seems to me that NA(P)T is more likely to be changed than connection type (PPP, PPTP, other). As I start using other applications, and run servers on my LAN, I'll likely want to set up some port forwards.
