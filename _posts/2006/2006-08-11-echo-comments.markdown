I've noticed a certain pattern in Spam Comments to this blog recently - and it's all since I disabled my rudimentary javascript Spam filter. Basically, the comment has a line or two echoed from the post, or another comment in the page, and then one or two simple additions to this phrase, such as "Good!" At first glance, they are all sane comments, except that they don't really add anything. And, they all point at pages that have a list of links, none of which have any relevance to the post from which they were linked to, and I assume would generate Advertising revenue for some scumbag. The other thing which is a trigger they are Spam comments is that the email addresses are all @yahoo.com, and the IP addresses are all from a small subnet. And the comments are appearing in bursts, and, I'll be honest here, I'm not getting too many comments any more. ![][1] Looks like it's time to re-implement the javascript filter in addition to Blogsome's (rather useless, apparently) CAPTCHA.
