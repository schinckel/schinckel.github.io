I've worked in fast food. Granted, it was a long time ago, and I was only a delivery driver, but it vexes me how often orders are mucked up by these (generally) young people. What hope does our society have when the youth can't listen properly and remember for thirty seconds what food I want. We went to KFC at Mitcham tonight, on the way home from a Training & Development session. Jaq was driving, so she ordered, and it went a little like this: 

> Jaq: Can I have a Zinger Bacon and Cheese Twister, in a large combo; and a second twister with cheese and no tomato please.  
> Stupid Drivethru Operator: Okay, so that's one Bacon and Cheese Twister in a large combo, and a twister with cheese and no tomato.  
> Jaq: No, the first one was a Zinger Twiser.  
> SDO: Sorry, we don't do Zinger Twisters.  
> Me (yelling from passenger seat): Yeah you do, I have them all of the time.  
> SOD: Silence.  
> Jaq (to me): So that's it then? Do I drive thru? 

\[We decide to drive to the window. As the previous car pulls away, a hand holding a large chips comes out of the window - obviously they forgot to pack the order properly.]

> New Drivethru Operator: We don't have them as a menu item, but we can make one up for you.  
> Jaq: Ok, thanks.  
> NDO: So, that's a Bacon and Cheese Zinger Twister combo. What drink did you want?  
> Jaq: There was another twister too, with cheese and no tomato.  
> NDO: Ok. What drink did you want then?  
> Jaq: Sunkist. 

\[Time passes. Drink is brought out. It's a small one.\]

> Jaq: Um, we ordered a large meal. Were you the girl I spoke to before? Because she read that bit of the order back to me.  
> NDO: No. Sorry. 

\[NDO takes drink, and brings back a large bottle.\]

> NDO: There you go, and there is your meal.

\[Bag is handed to us. As we begin to drive off, I notice there is a small chips in the bag. We stop. I then realise there are two small chips.\]

> Jaq: Excuse me, we ordered a large meal and got two small chips.  
> NDO: Yeah, we have run out of large chips containers. 

\[We drive home.\]

When we arrived home, it got even worse. Initially, we thought they'd stuffed up Jaq's order badly, by giving her tomatoes, and no cheese. But it turned out that they had just made my Zinger Twister sans Bacon and Cheese. So, I'm counting about 5 errors in our order, plus at least one in the order of the car before us. That's pretty pathetic, KFC.
