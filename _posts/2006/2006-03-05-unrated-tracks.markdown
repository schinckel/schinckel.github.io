I've been busily rating all of my iTunes tracks, and consider that I've done a very good job.  My Unrated playlist (Rating is _0_; Played Count is _0_; Genre does not contain _Classical_; Podcast is false) has only 224 tracks.  My total library is 7741 tracks, so it's about 97% done.  Not counting Classical tracks and Podcasts, obviously.

Actually, if I take this into account, my Music Library is only 5962 tracks, and I've rated about 96%.

Anyway, you get the picture.  An overwhelming number of my tracks are rated.  So now, I just sit back, and <del>count the money as it rolls in</del> let iTunes choose my music.

I've got a Smart Playlist called Party Shuffler, which I set my Party Shuffle to use as the source, and turn on _Play higher rated songs more often_.  The Party Shuffler playlist has the following Logic:

* Genre is not Classical
* Last Played is not in the last 3 days
* Genre is not Holiday
* Comment does not contain re-import
* Genre is not Books &amp; Spoken
* Genre is not Interview
* Match only checked songs
* Live Updating

I might be able to get rid of some of the Genre stuff, by having the _Skip when shuffling_ item checked on various tracks, but then I'd need to remember to do this to new music I import.

Oh, and I keep my rating window open, and every now and then re-rate the track that's playing - especially if I've decided I don't like the track quite so much anymore.
