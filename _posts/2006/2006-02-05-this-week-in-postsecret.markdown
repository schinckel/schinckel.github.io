I'm continuing to archive and present the pick (IMHO) of the week's PostSecret entries. ![][1] Actually, a very similar thing happened in my family. Apparently my Dad kicked a cat, and my sister and I didn't find out until her 21st birthday that it hadn't been bitten by a snake.  ![][2] ![][3] ![][4] This last one is only in here for the Speeling Poleese. That's a _horde_ of barbarians, but people _hoard_ things. From Apple's Dictionary.app: 

> USAGE Take care not to confuse the same-sounding words **hoard** and **horde**. A **hoard** is 'a secret stock or store of something' (a **hoard** of treasure), while a **horde** is a disparaging word for 'a large group of people' (**hordes** of fans descended on the stage). One way to remember the difference is to think of 'stashing your **hoard** behind the loose **board**' (note the spelling likeness of **hoard** and **board**).
