The Search Hilite plugin doesn't seem to function under Blogsome. I'm not sure if it used to, but it may be possible to modify the stylesheet, or do something (maybe using JavaScript) to highlight search terms. We can get the referer information, after all, and should be able to process this and make a guess as to if it's a search engine or not. Similarly, you cannot view Page 2 onwards of a site search: I'll look into this (and highlighting search terms here too, BTW).
