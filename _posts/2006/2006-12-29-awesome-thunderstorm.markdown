What's happening right now has to be the most awesome thunderstorm I've ever seen. It's right overhead, and there is a huge amount of lightning. It's only raining occasionally, and I've been outside a couple of times to try to get some photos. After a couple of hours of trying, I finally got a good one: ![Lightning Over Tree][1] I've tweaked and trimmed it a bit to make it really cool, but, even so, it's still pretty natural. And this wasn't even a particularly impressive strike. There have been ones that have been stacks better, but I've missed them. I have noticed that the camera seems to need as long after an exposure as the exposure time to process the shot. Which isn't very good if you are working with 30 second exposures, like I was to get this shot.
