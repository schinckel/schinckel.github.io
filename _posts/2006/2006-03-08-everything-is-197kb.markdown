The other day, when trying to find the old episodes of The Ricky Gervais Podcast (Series 1), I noticed something rather strange. Lots of items in the list of hits were 197KB. This made me very suspicious, as normally the podcasts were in the order of 13MB. A fairly significant difference. So I did a couple of other searches, and guess what. About 50% of everything I searched for (and I only did a couple) were 197KB. Interested, I downloaded one, and had a look inside. Aha! Setup.exe - someone is playing funny buggers. I didn't even try to find out exactly what this file does - I'm fairly sure it isn't really a Setup thing, just some malware. Good thing I'm on a Mac.
