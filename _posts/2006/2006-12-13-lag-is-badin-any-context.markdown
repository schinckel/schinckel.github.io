It's not just bad for gamers. Computers must be real-time in their feedback. Lightroom is pretty cool, but it is getting a little laggy for me at times. This is not cool, but becomes downright dangerous under some conditions. For instance, if I double-click a Shoot title, to edit it, and begin typing, sometimes the double-click doesn't take, and I'm not editing the title. Instead, my keypresses are passed on to the application to handle. Often, this isn't too much of a problem - the text will just be entered into the active text entry section, or ignored. But Lightroom uses some keyboard shortcuts without the Command key, for things like rating, or viewing in particular modes. This is bad, as it builds a queue of actions, and these happen, often causing the lag to become worse, as they are sometimes complex series. Luckily, I realised early, and was able to use the Undo feature to recover. And, while I'm at it, Firefox's handling of most Instant Preview type code is bad too - it lags between text entry and catchup. Not cool at all. IE can handle it much better. Can't believe I said that!
