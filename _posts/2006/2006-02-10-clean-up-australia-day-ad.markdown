_Clean Up Australia Day_ was started years ago, it's now expanded into Clean Up The World, or something similar. Apparently the first year was a huge success, and although the numbers of people involved now isn't as high, it's still pretty big. I've never been involved: it's always right around the time of my birthday, and whilst I support it, I'm a bit apathetic at times. Anyway, the new Advertisement for it is on TV now, and it's rather cool. It starts with a picture of Ayers Rock, sorry, _Uluru_, which when the light turns up is revealed to be a bag of garbage. Then, there is an image of the Olgas, which is really three cans of spray. Then we see the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which is a bicycle wheel and some other garbage. Finally we see the 12 Apostles, which are trash in the water. The clip ends with the phrase _“Don't let rubbish become part of the scenery.”_ I actually think it is an excellent Ad. It's punchy, clever and hopefully will cause some support. Will I be involved. I doubt it. I've got a 30th birthday party to organise, after all.
