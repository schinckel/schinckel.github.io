I know that a couple of people read this who are a bit interested in how my house renovations are coming along. Jaq and I have spent the last couple of months preparing the main living area: Kitchen, Dining, Lounge and Study. We knocked out about 3m of a wall which will have a table inserted into it, and replaced the floorboards, ceilings and fixed the walls. We have spent the last weekends doing some final prep for painting, and now painting the kitchen/study area. The edges of the wall where we had cut a big hole look great: we've use a Rondo Shadowline product to get lovely 10mm shadow lines around the framing, and now it's all painted, you can't see where the original plaster ends, and the cornice cement and top-cote start. It does look really nice. Similarly, where the old Air Conditioner was is almost invisible from the inside now. ![][1] ![][2] We'll build the kitchen ourselves - Ikea have some good kitchen cabinets, and we'll just get the doors made up. The kitchen will flow through into the study, although it will have a seperator that does distinguish between the two. ![][3] We also got some new furniture in the past couple of days: a Hans Wegner Daybed and some nice Danish beds. Furniture Auctions are the best place to find great bargains.
