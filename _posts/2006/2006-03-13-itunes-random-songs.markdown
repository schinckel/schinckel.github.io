Here I am listening to iTunes on Party Shuffle, and on comes: 

[If You Have A Cross To Bear You May As Well Use It As A Crutch][1] • [Moloko][2] • [Things To Make And Do][3] ★★

Hang on a bit! I heard this song earlier today. Let's see when: ![][4] That selected track is the one I'm listening to, and I last heard it at 12:27pm today. I thought so! And, as you can see, I stopped listening to music at around 2 pm. So, I must have only listened to it about a dozen tracks ago! Okay, so I'm using my Party Shuffle, maybe I've only got a small Playlist I'm selecting from. Nope. 6088 tracks. Hang on, I've got a playlist showing my Recently Played tracks. Morcheeba has finished now, but I can see how many tracks ago it was since I know the time it played. I heard the same track 25 tracks ago. That means when it first played, it was added immediately to the Party Shuffle again. I've read about the randomness of iTunes, but I still love it when something like this happens! 

[Starfuckers, Inc.][5] • [Nine Inch Nails][6] • [Triple J Hottest 100 - Volume 7][7] ½
