This post was in the Blogsome Forums tonight: ![][1] No, you aren't looking for "mail friends" - you are looking for people to click on your silly little links, and get you some linkage lovin' - which probably somehow results in you getting money. And what's worse? You aren't even on Blogsome, the forums where you have posted this. Maybe, just maybe, I would have had some thoughts about the validity of this post if you had at least some relationship to Blogsome. Well, I ain't standing for none of it. Your Spam post is gone, and if you put any more up, well, gosh darn it I'll just delete them too. And your little dog, too.
