I had a couple of interesting comments today, and when I viewed them in the list view, I noticed there was a comment awaiting moderation with the same format: ![][1] But obviously a whole lot more links. ![][2] If you look at the times, the one with heaps of links was posted first, and then it looks like the poster realised it wasn't working, and posted comments without heaps of links, which made it into the comments stream. Needless to say, _1insurancereview_ has made it into my blacklist. And the word _insurance_ is very close to making my moderate list. These are real comments, not trackbacks. I am finding a few Comment Spams now, I wonder if my JavaScript isn't working?
