For Christmas, we bought a DeLonghi Metropolis Espresso machine. I'm pretty happy with the quality of coffee it makes, however it seems to have developed a pretty major fault, since I last used it. The machine has two thermostats, one for heating the plate to the right temperature for brewing coffee, the other for heating to the right temperature for frothing milk. The coffee thermostat seems to be broken, so the machine will not heat up when it's just in 'coffee' mode. I can get the machine to heat up by flicking the switch 'frothing' mode, but then I need to be there to turn it off as it gets to the right temperature. I'll have to get this fixed. The machine is only three months old, and I've been taking very good care of it! I've sent off an email to DeLonghi customer service. It will be interesting to see how they respond to email.
