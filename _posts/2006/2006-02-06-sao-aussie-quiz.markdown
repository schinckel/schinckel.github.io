[SAO Aussie Quiz][1] Yay! I'm truly an Aussie, as I got 20/20. I reckon' that most city slickers won't have heard #10. Of course, the real phrase is "Come behind!", and the alternate is "Get away back!" My only hassle is that it should be smart_arses_.com (For all of my overseas readers, that's how we pronounce the word. Arrrrse. Long R.).
