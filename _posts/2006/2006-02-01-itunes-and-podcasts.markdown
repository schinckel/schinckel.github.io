I won't deny at times I am late to the party. I've just discovered listening to Podcasts - mainly ABC programs, as it turns out, but nonetheless, it's a start. Anyway, being on dialup means it can take an age to download longer podcasts. And if iTunes decides it's going to give up on a Podcast, it cannot just do a resume on the transfer. It must start all over again. Bad news, from where I'm listening.
