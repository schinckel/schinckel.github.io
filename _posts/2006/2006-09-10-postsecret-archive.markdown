It's been a while since I did this, but here are my favourite (or, in one case, least favourite) items from this week's PostSecret: ![][1] ![][2] ![][3] ![][4] And, it's nice to know I'm not the only one who thinks that the media coverage of someone's passing was a bit too much ([Smack Dab in the Middle][5]). And now we have Brocky to mourn for, too.
