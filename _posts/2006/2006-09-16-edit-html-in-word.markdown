I had an HTML file I wanted to look at the source of, so I right-clicked on it in Windows, and chose "Edit". Tell me Mr Gates, why on earth would I want to edit it in Word? I've never ever opened or saved an HTML file from Word, I'm not about to start now. I expected it to load up in Notepad, which would have been bearable (a real text editor would have been better), but not Word.
