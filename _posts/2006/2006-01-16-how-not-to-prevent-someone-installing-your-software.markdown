I have data in my Apple _Address Book_, that I'd like to merge into a _Word_ Document (or even an _AppleWorks_ one, if it comes to that). However, there only seems to be one way to do that - using a commercial piece of software called _Office Power Pack_. Which doesn't seem to be available anymore, other than through a couple of download mirrors. So I downloaded it, just to see what it's like. And when you go to install it, it asks for a license key. But, if you look inside the Installer.app package, you'll find the applications that it installs. Double-clicking on one kindly informs you of where it needs to be installed to work. Dragging it there makes it work - although it doesn't seem to be accesible from a menu within Word. â€¢ Having done this, I'm glad I didn't pay money for this. It is limited to a subset of the Address Book data (no mobile phone, no Related Names fields, which I need), and doesn't even keep a live query, but exports the data to a text file. Hell, I could have done this with a shell script and _contacts_. Or some fancy AppleScripting, almost. What I'd like to see is an ODBC connection to the Address Book. Or even better a proper link between Word and the Address Book. Perhaps _Pages_ can do this. I might have to investigate.
