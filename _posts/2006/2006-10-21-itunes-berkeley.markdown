University of California (Berkeley) now has a whole lot of lectures available as downloadable audio. You can get Podcasts of them, or get them via the [iTunes Music Store, Berkeley edition][1]. I'm not getting them as Podcasts, since the ones on iTunesU are already pre-tagged, and the courses I'm getting are not currently running, so I don't need to automatically get new ones. The only tagging fault I've found is that they are missing:  Remember playback position  Skip when shuffling Which I think are important for this type of thing. I've also noticed some Podcast/downloads via iTunes can be paused and resumed, unfortunately, these ones can't. Finally, a neat point is that it automatically creates a new Playlist, and a new Playlist Folder.
