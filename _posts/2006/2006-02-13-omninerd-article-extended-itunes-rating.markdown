[OmniNerd - Articles: Extended iTunes Rating][1]

> iTunes has the ability to store ratings of a finer gradient than just the number of stars. Higher rated tracks should be played more, but is this always the case? I needed to know the answer to this.

This is the long-awaited article I wrote for OmniNerd, expanding on the results I obtained in my ratings research and experiment using iTunes. Well worth the read, if I do say so myself!
