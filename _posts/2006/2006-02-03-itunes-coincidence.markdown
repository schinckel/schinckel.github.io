Having done some experiments about play counts, and having read some articles about the randomness of _iTunes_ random play, I have no doubt that it is fairly random. I know from my Computer Science training that it's virtually impossible to generate completely random data from a computer system - they just aren't designed that way. It is possible to get the data from an outside source, like keypresses, or the time between them, or the mouse movements, or whatever. I do recall that if you use a function like `random()`, you need to seed it beforehand, and you should do this with a value that will change each time the program is run, as if you seed `random()` with a constant, it will return the same sequence of values each time it is run. Still, it amuses me when coincidences occur with iTunes. I got this one tonight: ![][1] This is unusual in a couple of ways: the first is that _Tim Rogers_ is a member of _You Am I_. So, to start with, I had two songs by virtually the same artist one after another. But _iTunes_ could not know this, as there is no reference to _You Am I_ in the second song (which is in the larger part of the window), and no reference to _Tim Rogers_ in the drawer - which contains the data about the song that actually played first. The next unusual thing is that both of them have the name _Part 1/One_, or at least it's included in the name. The third weird thing was that two tracks later another _Tim Rogers and the Temperance Union_ track played.
