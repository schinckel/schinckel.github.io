From the comments to the hint about [how to find out the serial number of the last connected iPod][1], I came across the following CLI/Terminal command. `defaults read com.apple.iPod` The program will then provide various information, such as this one: `“Use Count” = 143; ` It also shows the date the iPod(s) was/were last connected. I'd forgotten about the 40Gb iPod I bought from OfficeWorks, before getting it home and finding out it was an older one, still full of music (and in a new box, meaning someone had bought a new one, and returned the old one…). I returned it the next day, but here are it's details: 
    
    000A2700026661B2 = {
                Connected = 2004-10-09 10:42:14 +0930; 
                "Firmware Version" = 307; 
                ID = 000A2700026661B2; 
                "Serial Number" = JQ410859PNU; 
                "Software Version" = 35684352; 
                "Use Count" = 9; 
            };

I didn't realise it was quite that long ago… September 10th 2004. By the way, a Google of that Serial Number returns no hits. Maybe I should report it stolen…
