[History News Network: "Buy Danish"][1] There's apparently been somewhat of a furore over some Danish cartoons allegedly portraying Muslims in a not so favourable light. Various Muslim countries have called for a boycott. Various groups are calling for an anti-boycott. Since Danish furniture is pretty much "teh sh1t", and we have just bought a _Hans Wegner_ day bed, I'll pretend it's all part of that.
