It's really cool that people are still working on the Firmware upgrades for the NSLU2, and I went to upgrade the firmware today to try to get MySQL working properly. The file is 6.5 MB, and my download keeps failing at 3 MB. And I can't resume, as I can't find the actual address - they've done a pretty good job of making that hard to find. Annoying...
