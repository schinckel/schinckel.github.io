I'm not sure if this is a 'feature' of general _Gmail_, or only the _Gmail for Hosted Domains _variety. I had the need to send an executable file, and I had zipped it up, as there were also support files in the directory. I attempted to send it, and Gmail complained: 

> Sorry, ArchiveName.zip contains an executable file. Schinckel.net policy prevents sending these files, as they provide a security risk.

I had to rename it to `.zip.jpg`, and then resend it. I'm not an idiot. I know when a file I am sending is relatively clean (as clean as can be expected), and I am prepared to take the risk. I manage the domain, and I have never checked any box about preventing .exe files. Aargh!
