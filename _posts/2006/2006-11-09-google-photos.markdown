Just noticed [Google Photos][1] in a browser window. This is a new service, according to my reckoning, but is really just Picasa, which Google bought some time ago. New info is that you can use iPhoto to upload images, as evidenced at [Mac Tools][2]. I'm glad Google decided to use iPhoto instead of making a Mac version of Picasa. Now all I need is a version of iPhoto that doesn't totally suck with a large library of photos. Oh, and 250Mb ain't real big for an online photo album. I'm up to around 6Gb at home, and that's without really trying.
