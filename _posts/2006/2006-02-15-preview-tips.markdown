[MyMac.com: Macspiration 22 - Four More Hidden Preview Tricks][1]

  1. **Change the File Format.** Yep, knew this one.
  2. **Scan an image directly into Preview.** Excellent. That's one more reason not to have to load up Photoshop, just to scan an image!
  3. **Take a Screenshot.** Harder than âŒ˜$ (Cmd-Shift-4) for Window/Selection (Space Bar to toggle mode), or âŒ˜# (Cmd-Shift-3) for Screenshot. Can do timed screen, but generally don't need this with âŒ˜#.
  4. **Slideshow.** Didn't know it specifically, but I did know you can drag multiple documents to Preview at once and cycle through them.

So, one out of four ain't too bad!
