I was a bit peckish waiting for the train on Friday, so I bought a packet of chips. Smiths have a new flavour range out, including Australian Sausage Sizzle. They actually weren't too bad. They did taste a bit like a sausage. I remember the good old days of the Roast Beef and Mustard chips. Derek and I used to have a packet of them every Sunday for lunch. And it was just like having a Roast Sunday Dinner. But easier to prepare.
