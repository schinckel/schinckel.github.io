Apparently, the following command changes the scroll speed under MacOS X when using a scroll wheel mouse: `write -globalDomain com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling _x.x_` Where `x.x` is replaced by a float, I use 2.5 I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes, but I'll keep playing with it. Maybe it only changes it after a login.
