I use MacOS X Stickies as desktop reminders, and by an large they are very cool. Just recently, however, they got a whole lot less useful for me. Something has gone wrong, and I can no longer edit the text in any sticky note. I can select it, and I can paste into it, but I can't type into it. And, before you ask, I've trashed the prefs, and deleted my `~/Library/StickiesDatabase` file, all to no avail. And google can't tell me anything about it either.
