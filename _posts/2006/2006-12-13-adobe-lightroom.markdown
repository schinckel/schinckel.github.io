Well, I've moved over to Adobe Lightroom. It's still a beta, and it's free in a couple of ways for me - the first is that it was a no-cost download. The second, more important missing cost is that I gave it a set of my photos that are hard-linked to the originals, so there is no extra disk space usage. It uses a slightly different schemata than iPhoto - photos are stored in "Shoots" rather than being date sorted, but it still looks rather good. It seems a bit faster than iPhoto, but not as snappy as I'd like it to be. Maybe I just need more RAM.
