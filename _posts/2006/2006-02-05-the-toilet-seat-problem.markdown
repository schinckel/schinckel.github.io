[The Science Creative Quarterly Â» A GAME THEORETIC APPROACH TO THE TOILET SEAT PROBLEM][1]

> The toilet seat problem has been the subject of much controversey. In this paper we consider a simplified model of the toilet seat problem. We shall show that for this model there is an inherent conflict of interest which can be resolved by a equity solution.

We've found the ideal solution is that the Toilet Seat Lid is to be left down at all times: then everyone using the toilet incurs the same cost each time they "perform an operation", be it a #1 operation or a #2 operation.
