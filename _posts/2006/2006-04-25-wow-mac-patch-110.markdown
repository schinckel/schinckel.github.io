If anyone in Adelaide has downloaded the Macintosh version of the WoW 1.10 patch, and would be kind enough to pop it onto a CD for me (_WoW-1.10.0-enUS-patch.app_), I will gladly collect it from you, and pay you in beer, wine or your chosen liquor. I'm stuck behind a 56k modem, and the wait is killing me. 360Mb before I can even think about playing WoW, and I'm only at 7.13Mb. According to the _Blizzard Downloader_: About 38 hours remaining.
