Every Australian Child knows the story about Ned Kelly. The famous outlaw was captured while wearing body armour made from old farm equipment, and is an iconic figure in Australian history. I came across a picture today, that was a replica of the banners proclaiming his execution. I'll quote the last part of the text: 

> His last words before he was executed were, "I guess it has come to this." And shortly after "Such is life"

Apparently, he was still able to talk after being executed...
