Saw a Google Ad today: Get Paid to do Surveys. Went to the site: here is an excerpt... 

> Sit Back, Relax, and Get Paid for What You Think!! 
> 
>   * Online Companies will pay YOU from $5 to $125 for Each Survey!
>   * Get paid to participate in online focus groups $50 to $150 per hour!

It went on a bit like this for a while, and then... 

> ** Just one hour online can pay for your registration! ** Normally $59.95 Today's Special Registration Price ONLY $34.95! This low price will be ending soon so hurry and take advantage of this special offer!

So, you are telling me I need to pay $35 (US, I assume) to register to do some surveys, and then I'll get paid. I don't really trust you, you know...
