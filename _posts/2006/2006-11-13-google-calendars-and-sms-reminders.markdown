I'm yet to find a suitable method of syncing my Palm Zire with my Google Calendars, at least one that allows syncing both ways. I'm not really ready to start having my Zire with me until I can do this - I'd also like to be able to sync my PalmOS contacts with the GMail contacts, but that might never occur. I did discover something cool today, however. Google Calendar supports SMS reminders. Including to Australian phones. Now, this might not seem like much, but in Australia, we don't pay to receive SMS messages, only to send them. Thus, I can set up Google SMS reminders at no cost to myself. Whoops, there goes a reminder. It's lunch time, according to that message...
