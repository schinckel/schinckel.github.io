I've just converted an Audio Book to AAC - I'm ashamed to say it's _The Da Vinci Code_, but, well... Anyway, I was a bit peeved that it doesn't show up as an Audiobook when you use the search feature of iTunes. And none of the tips I came across seemed to fix it: 

  * Rename the file so it's *.m4b instead of *.m4a
  * Use the Make Bookmarkable script from Doug's AppleScripts
  * Set the Type Code to "M4B "

Then I read this, at [macintouch][1] ([iPod: File Management][2]): 

> If I remember correctly, an iTunes audio book is little more than a renamed AAC file. The steps necessary for making your own are pretty simple: 
> 
>   1. Convert the file to AAC format (if it isn't already)
>   2. Make sure it's not in the iTunes library. (Otherwise iTunes may not recognize the change.)
>   3. Set the file type to "M4B " if you're on a Mac (only necessary if you're using a Mac)
>   4. Rename the file to have an ".m4b" extension
>   5. Add it back to the iTunes library

Look at #2. That does the trick. Now, I just need to see if the _Join Together and Chapterize_ script will ever finish...
