It's now possible to find the names of images you have uploaded to Blogsome: [http://schinckel.net/wp-admin/iimage-browser.php][1] Allows me to browse all of the images I have uploaded. I don't think I can delete them, but I can see what files are there, and then reference these in a blog post. You'll want to replace _schinckel_ with whatever word you chose for your blog. This function was added with the WYSIWYG editor plugin.
