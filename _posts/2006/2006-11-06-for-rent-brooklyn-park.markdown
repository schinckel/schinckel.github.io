Due to my stupidity in renting my flat to an (alleged) wife-basher, it is now vacant again. If anyone wants to live on Marion Road, just of Henley Beach Road, leave a comment, with your email address in the right box, and I'll get back to you. Price is $265 p.w., available now. Stainless steel kitchen, Airconditioner, Garage, Security System. Quiet group of 5, established water-wise garden. Close to public transport and late-night supermarket. No pets, or wankers, please. Please, children, no superfluous comments. I will issue detentions.
