I received four interesting Trackback Spams today, on two seperate posts. Often, when I've been hit by a trackback Spammer there is one Spam with a heap of links, which gets picked up by the Spam Filter, and then a couple that have one or two of the same links, which gets through. These ones weren't like that - the only link was the URL value, and they all had to do with MP3 files - although neither of the posts did. The most interesting thing is that they appeared to be legit comments - if you didn't read the post, you could believe they were responding to it. I've left them there for now, after removing the URL value.
