I've had some DNS issues with my ADSL connection, but it took me a while to work out that's what they were. Basically, sometimes viewing a page would fail, but it would generally work the second time you refreshed. So, I checked out some settings. I was using the DNS addresses given by my upstream DHCP server, and these are either overloaded, or not working properly, or both. So, now I'm using alternate addresses, and haven't had a lookup failure as yet.
