Tonight on Channel 10 (the only commercial TV station in Australia not to yet align itself with a web portal: c.f. nineMSN, yahoo7), we saw the premiere of the intellectually stimulating _Australia's Brainiest Radio Star_ at 7:30pm. I only saw the last two minutes, enough to see the winner fluke the last question. What I want to know is: where were Dr Karl and Adam Spencer, of [Triple J][1]/[ABC][2] Local Radio? Surely they have to be amongst the smartest Radio personalities. And Dr Karl is hardly not a star! The first question I saw was something about a cricket ball vs. a pendulum, asking the question _a cricket ball has more degrees of_ ... freedom. The joker answering got this wrong, which I'm fairly sure both of my champions would not have. The determinant question asked _What is the correct term for a group of 7 musicians?_ The contestant ummed and aahed, before shakily guessing (correctly) a septet.
