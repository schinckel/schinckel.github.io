I converted this theme, Connections, to the Blogsome format. I also put a credit to myself (and another to the original theme author) into the template file. I noticed today a whole heap of new links to me via technorati. It turns out that lots of people have put this theme into their blogs, and left the credit as it is down the bottom: 

> Blogsome conversion and all content © Matt Schinckel, unless otherwise indicated.

I've changed that, so it now says: 

> Blogsome conversion © Matt Schinckel, content © {authors} unless otherwise indicated.

I'd love people to update their template - it makes me feel bad, taking all that credit for the content. In my template it has a bit more code, that automatically puts all of the blog's authors in as links. The more automation the better, I always say. Also, if you use Connections, you don't need to keep the chinese characters, they say "Tiger Paint" (or something similar). You can put whatever you want in there.
