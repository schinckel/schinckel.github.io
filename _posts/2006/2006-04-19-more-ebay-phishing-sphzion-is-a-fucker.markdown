Yet another eBay phishing site. This time located at (line broken deliberately): _http://hyper6.amuser-net.ne.jp/~sphzion/dzb/random_msg/ws/ signin.ebay/eBayISAPI.dll/SignIn&pUserId;/index.html_ Again, looks very convincing. However, the start of the URL is always a dead giveaway. ![][1] The interesting thing about this scam is that when you try to login, it fails (naturally, as the site doesn't know your real password), but then passes you through to the real site, so that if you try again, you'll succeed. Naturally, I entered a few fake details in, just to let him know he's been caught. What this loser doesn't realise is that he's hosted this on his homepage. [http://hyper6.amuser-net.ne.jp/~sphzion/dzb/index2.htm][2] Which also has a couple of email addresses: 

  * sph@x.age.ne.jp
  * ohkawa@mb.gallery.ne.jp

Make no mistake. This guy is a scammer! As per usual, this is being forwarded to _spoof@ebay.com_ as we speak.
