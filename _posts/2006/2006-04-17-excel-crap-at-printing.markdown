I'm having a bad evening. I've been trying to print several pages of an Excel document to a PDF file, so I can send it off. What it's doing, however, is not printing them to one PDF, but seperate files. Now, that's not too bad, but each file has the same name, so only the most recent one is actually being left on the disk. What I've had to do is print each one seperately, and combine them in Adobe Acrobat. What would have happened if I didn't have Acrobat? Fuck Microsoft.
