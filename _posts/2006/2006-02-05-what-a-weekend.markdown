It started on Friday night with Touch training. I coached rather than training, as I was carrying a bit of a hamstring injury, and I wanted to give it a bit more rest. Still, it meant I didn't get home until around 8. I'm just glad I chose not to ride my bike! Saturday was the annual _Colley Reserve_ 5-a-side Touch Carnival. Normally Touch is played with 6 on the field, but for a more exciting game, and because the fields are a bit smaller, this carnival plays with 5. It's mixed, so 3 boys and 2 girls are the order of the day. I played in the UniSA team, knowing only two of the players beforehand. The guys, and most of the girls were pretty nice people, and we wound up making the final in the Pool B division. Which we lost, to a team that pretty much plays together all of the time.  When I got home, at around 6pm or so, I started doing some editing on my post I'm writing over on [OmniNerd][1]. I actually spent a fair bit of time on this, and although I disagreed with the editor's comments on a couple of things (like placing an embedded clause in commas, something I do) I feel that the feedback made my article better. It's still not ready to publish, but it's probably 75% of the way there. The most interesting thing for me is that it's a different style of writing than a blog post. A blog post, by it's nature, is very free-flowing, and can at times lack structure. I very rarely edit my posts on this blog, although I sometimes correct errors. If I make them. (Reminds me of the joke: _I was wrong once. I thought I was wrong, but I was actually right._) By the time Jaq got home from little Shae's birthday party (9:30pm), freaking out because there was a _big_ spider on the car, which I had to squish for her, I was about ready for bed, so I dozed almost right off. Jaq had to head into Uni this morning at 11, so I got up just as she left, and started finalizing my Tax documents. I put all of my stuff into a spreadsheet, and it didn't really take as long as I thought it might. Then, I caught up on all of my RSS feeds, and by the time Jaq got home this time, I had to head off to State League. I played in the Mixed, where we won 8-2 (I only scored one of these, but set up a couple of others, including a great _boomer_ with Karina McL), and then coached the Mens from the box (there is another playing coach, but sometimes it's handy to have extra eyes off the field).
