This is super cool. While attempting to get back to a 'normal' listing of characters, I happened to click on **By Radical**, and up came a list of characters _and their meanings_! ![][1] Thus, it's possible to create your own meanings, without having to use Google! (I last wrote about the Character Palette in [Show Selected Character][2].)
