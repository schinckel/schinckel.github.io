I set up a Gmail account for Jaq today - she was apparently losing some email, and this is a bit of a test to see if the problem is with our ISP, or with the forwarding service. Anyway, after setting it up, I set up Apple Mail, and noticed that some of the settings were different to how I set it up. So I switched back over to set mine up again, and looked up the settings. And my Google settings page is different, and contains vastly different information. Including using _googlemail_ instead of _gmail_ in the server names. And mine doesn't have the nice pictures!
