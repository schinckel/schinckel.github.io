Okay, so they are compatible with most MP3 players, yet they are not MP3 files. Oh, and might I add they are not compatible with iPods, the most common MP3 playerâ€¦ It gets better: [ABC Digital Music Service - abcshop.com.au Downloads - Powered by DestraMusic.com V3.0][2]

Or Linux, or other OS, or anything relatively old. Nice one ABC. This site gets even worse. They claim to support "most MP3 players," yet in actual fact only support WMA players, a subset of personal music players. I suspect this is verging on false advertising.
