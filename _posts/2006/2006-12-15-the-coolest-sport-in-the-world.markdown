It's no secret I think Touch Football is the coolest sport in the world. However, a couple of sports I caught on SBS's broadcast of the Asian Games came pretty close. The first one was Kabaddi. It's basically chasey, which makes it cool enough. But it's got some other cool rules, and is truly stunning to watch. Grown men 'tagging' one another, and then trying to escape without being pinned by them. The other was Sepaktakraw. Think of volleyball, but instead of using a large air filled ball, use a small cane one. And instead of hitting the ball with your hands, use your feet. There's still a high net, and this one is also amazing to watch.
