It's amazing how much and how quickly one can change their attitude towards things. Take the following comment (by me), posted on the Blogsome Forums on Sun Aug 07, 2005 10:28 am. 

> I try and avoid JavaScript where possible , and cannot tell you if that is valid code or not. What I would suggest is that that code does not belong in the StyleSheet - put it in the Main page template, and see how that goes. 

I have become a full convert to the greatness that is JavaScript. Since that point in time I've developed quite a library of functions that control various features on this blog, from disallowing Spam comments, to making checkboxes appear as lovely images instead of the ugly normal checkbox.  Perhaps my favourite component is my floating window. I've mentioned it briefly, but it basically allows for `<div>` tags to float over the top of other items on the page. They can also remain fixed while the page scrolls, yet be moved to another position, and stay on that point, relative to the window. (This is broken under IE, and others that do not support `position="fixed"`). I think the irony is that I was very opposed to JavaScript, but had to use it as there was no other way to really control stuff under Blogsome. But, as chance would have it, I discovered just how powerful a language it really is, and now most of my coding is done in JavaScript, with the remainer being PHP Smarty Tags. I can't remember the last time I wrote a python script. In all honesty, I'd love to be able to supplant all of my JavaScript with python, but I don't think that will happen. Browsers will always support JavaScript, and XMLHttpRequest() really is pretty cool, but I don't think they'll start inlcuding python any time soon.
