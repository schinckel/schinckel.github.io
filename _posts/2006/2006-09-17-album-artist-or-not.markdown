I'm not sure whether I'm going to use **Album Artist** across my iTunes Library, or not. I've already used it in a couple of places, where I have several albums of the same title, such as _Greatest Hits_, or _Behind The Sun_. But the other place I may wish to use it is where on an artist's album there are co-artists for some tracks. The one that springs to mind is _Paul Mac_, _3000 Feet High_. For most of these tracks, Paul Mac credits the singer - generally it was _Abby Dobson_, _Peta Morris_, or someone else. The point is, until the advent of **Album Artist** as a tag, to keep the album together I had Paul Mac as the designated **Artist**. Then, in the case of a “featuring” credit, which there is on each track in this case except the last two, I put _(feat. Additional Artist)_ into the song **Name**. Now, I am in a bit of a pickle. I can instead make the **Album Artist** _Paul Mac_, and in the **Artist** field, put _Paul Mac featuring Additional Artist_. This is all well and good, and the files are stored in the _Paul Mac_ directory, but then I have more artists listed in the **Artist** browser. Luckily, because I'm somewhat anal with my tagging of tracks, all of my _featuring_ credits are stored as indicated in the song title, so it was easy to create a script that parses the track name, and grabs out the additional artist(s). It is also possible to not add in the **Album Artist** tag on tracks that are compilations. However, because of the issue indicated above, I haven't run that script on all of the tracks in my library yet. I'm really not sure which path to take.
