Apparently, today is iTunesRater's first birthday. It was a year ago today that I first posted about the program I had created to rate tracks on a 0-100 scale. And it was only a couple of days ago that I realised most of the rating I've done has been a bit of a waste of time: iTunes seems to only take into account the actual star rating, not the real value. Except for tracks that are 1/2 star. I'm going to write a post on OmniNerd detailing my experiments and results, when I get a bit of time.
