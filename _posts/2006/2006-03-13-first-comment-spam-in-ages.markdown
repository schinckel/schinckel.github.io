Well, I got a Comment Spam tonight, and as the title indicates, it's the first Comment Spam I've had since I implemented my Captcha. ![][1] I know it's a Comment, not a Trackback, as I have code that discriminates between the two. If I continue to get them, I'll have to either modify my Comment Spam protection, or look into using the Blogsome one, which I don't really want to do, as it doesn't 'look' like my site when the page is loaded.
