I'm not yet sure how I feel about Christopher Alexander and his ideas about what has been wrong with Architechture over the past 100 years or so. I think as an exercise (more for my own mental stimulation than anything else), I'll listen again to the [programme recently broadcast][1] on [ABC][2] [Radio National][3] (no Podcast, [but I figured out a way to download rather than stream it][4]...) and perhaps summarize and critique his ideas. Of course, there's always the chance I won't finish doing that...
