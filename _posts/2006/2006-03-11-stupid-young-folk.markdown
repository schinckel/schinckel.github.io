Don't even get me started on the inanity of young people these days. The latest, and stupidest thing I just heard during an ad break in Video Hits (I despise their latest look, btw): 

> Get your personal Chinese symbol sent directly to your phone! Just SMS "c" plus your year of birth, for example 1980, to 19 XX XX.

This is just wrong on so many levels. For christ's sake, _every person born in the same year as you_, which is probably most of your stupid little friends from school, _has the same symbol as you_. That's hardly a personal symbol. Secondly, is the company seriously suggesting that it's customers are so stupid as to _require an example of what a year looks like_? But then, these people will quite happily pay $4 to send a text message, and receive in return a sampled down version of a song on their mobile phone, rather than pay $1 to download it legally, and then use some simple software to convert it to a format suitable for use on said phone. And then probably only use it as their ringtone for about a week, before repeating the process.
