I've had a couple of "challenging" comments on a couple of posts I've made over the past couple of days. It all stems from the fact that a large group of students have "discovered" my blog, and decided to make some comments about and on it. This is not the first time that students I teach have come across it, but in the past, they appeared to be a bit more mature about how they dealt with the fact that I am a person, not just a teacher. I'm close to putting moderation on the posts, as it's somewhat annoying to have to remove those that I deem to be inappropriate. Which brings me to the point I want to make. By commenting on a person's blog, you are effectively visiting their house, and leaving your mark. It's my blog, I've put a lot of effort into tweaking the template, and even more into creating content that is, to me at least, meaningful and sometimes important. I reserve the right to remove comments I decide are inappropriate. I'll usually leave comments that are opposing to my point of view, except if I feel they go too far. If it gets too bad, I'll just block access from a variety of IP addresses. Like yours.
