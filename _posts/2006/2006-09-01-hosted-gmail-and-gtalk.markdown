There exists a small bug in Adium, which apparently has been fixed in an upcoming version, which means that hosted Gmail accounts cannot sign in as GTalk accounts. To fix it, I needed to create a new Jabber account, with the following settings: **Account.** Jabber ID: _matt@schinckel.net_ Password: •••••••••••••••• **Options.** Connect Server: _talk.google.com_ Resource: Adium Port: _5223_ _â˜‘ Force old-style SSL_ Then it connected fine, first time.
