I just thought of a great addition to a sidebar: _links in this post_. Thus, a user would see a list of all off-site (or even on-site) links, and be able to follow one or all of these without having to go through all of the post. Probably going to be more useful on posts that are really long. Easy to do in JavaScript, but could be done in Smarty too.
