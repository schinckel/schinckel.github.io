Now that it's possible to view which images have been uploaded to a Blogsome blog, and it's possible to delete unwanted images, I'm going to go through and remove any unused images, and resize some of the larger images I uploaded a while ago. I've also found a way to upload any type of file: such as JavaScript.js, Python.py and AdobeAcrobat.pdf documents.
