I have my Dock hidden, and aligned to the left of the screen. I don't really use it for much other than a launcher, although I do have a couple of shortcuts to folders there as well. I tried to drag an image from a website into one of these folders. I can drag like this to the desktop, or any open window. Why can't I do this to a folder Dock icon? This seems crazy!
