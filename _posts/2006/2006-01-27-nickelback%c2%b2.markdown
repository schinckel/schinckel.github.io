[Brandon: As if there weren't already enough reasons to laugh at Nickelback][1] I started downloading this, just for fun. And then listened to it when there was about 750k downloaded. I could not believe just how similar these two songs are. The drums play the same beat. The guitar riffs are pretty similar too. And then the heavy part starts. **And it's at exactly the same time.** Does Nickelback have a formula for creating their songs? I have to finish downloading this, it's just too good. (And I wonder if the person who originally mashed them up is a fan…?)
