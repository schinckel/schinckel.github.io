![Victoria Bitter: Yep! I bet they are!][1]

The AFL Grand Final was on this weekend, and no Victorian teams were in it (or even got close). This is particularly galling for the Vics, as the AFL used to be the VFL, and until very recently, the Victorian teams were still the powerhouses. Oh well. It's all fun and games, isn't it...
