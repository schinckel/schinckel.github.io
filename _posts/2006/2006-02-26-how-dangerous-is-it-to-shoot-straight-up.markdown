[The VCSi Forums - How dangerous is it to shoot straight up][1]

> According to tests undertaken by Browning at the beginning of the century and recently by L .C. Haag, the bullet velocity required for skin penetration is between 45 and 60 metres per second which is within the velocity range of falling bullets. Of course, skin penetration is not required in order to cause serious or fatal injury and any responsible person will never fire bullets into the air in this manner.

A couple of months ago, I was having a discussion with some friends about shooting straight up in the air. I can't remember the result, but here is a nice article detailing the physics and results.
