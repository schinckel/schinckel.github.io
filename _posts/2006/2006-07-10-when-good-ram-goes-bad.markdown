I bought an extra 1 gig of Ram, and was extremely happy with it over about a week. And then bad things started happening. First, WoW crashed just after I got to a big boss in Scholomance. Then, I was getting reports from Windows that it was recovering from a serious system error, and finally Windows wouldn't boot at all. I tracked all of this down to what I thought was a dodgy stick of Ram. Which I returned, and got a replacement. The guy at the shop mentioned then that there were some potential issues with using this particular Ram in a Dual Channel situation. That is where the Ram is paired in slots of the same value and speed for a supposed performance increase. Why he didn't mention this before, when I first bought the Ram is beyond me, since I did specifically state it was for this type of implementation. So, I've solved the problem by not having the Ram paired. And that seems, for the time being, to have solved the problem. I'm not sure how much of a performance increase I would get from Interleaving the Ram, but I'm happy it's working now without crashing.
