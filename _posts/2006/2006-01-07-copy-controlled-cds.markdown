I have a CD, _Talkie-Walkie_, by _Air_, that has a sticker on it labelled: 

> Copy Controlled: See reverse for details.

On the back is a largish label, which says (amongst other things, including system requirements): 

> On some equipment, for example car CD players playback problems may be encountered.

(This is also repeated in several languages). This is an EMI CD, and with some trepidation, I put it into my iMac, to rip to my iTunes library. It gave me no problems at all. Ripped perfectly. Pretty effective copy control system, EMI.
