Grace Park, the stunning Korean-Canadian actress who plays Boomer in the new BattleStar Galactica also had a short role in the first episode of the second season of Dark Angel. Her line: 

> Copulation was unsuccessful, Ma'am. X5-698 failed to achieve minimum mission requirements, Ma'am.

![][1] At which point the bumbling idiot who couldn't achieve minimum mission requirements was bundled off. Mind you, she's hot, but she's nothing next to Jessica Alba. 

> Successful copulation between myself and X5-452, Ma'am. \[Pause\] Twice.

![][2] You dog, you.
