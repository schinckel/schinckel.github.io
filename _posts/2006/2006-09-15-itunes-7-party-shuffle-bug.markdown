Well, I've come across a bug in iTunes 7. I use Party Shuffle, but since I often spend time sorting through my 7626 songs, 784 podcasts, and so on, I like to be able to just add tracks to the Party Shuffle, and not have to use "Play Next in Party Shuffle". So I have 0 upcoming songs shown. Just so it's always a surprise what's going to play next, unless I've already decided I want a particular song. With iTunes 7, however, having 0 tracks shown next means that it stops playing when there are no more tracks. This is bad.
