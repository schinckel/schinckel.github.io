I had the following Adsense Ad on a page I viewed from my own site tonight: [![][1]][2] I don't even know what it's trying to sell! I think it's something to do with a chat system. Let's ask google: 

> Free Cat Accesses Direct Dialogue free simply! www.Chat-Land.Org Free Cat www.Chat-Land.Org 

Oh, excellent! I'd forgotten that _Chat_ means _Cat_ in French! Someone's giving away cats, and for some reason, my site got picked! I gotta get one! Free talking, and a Free Cat. • But seriously, why am I getting a French Ad on my site? Have I written anything in my blog about France, or in French? How does Google Adsense even know I did a little bit of French at Uni to try and meet girls (well, now I know how Google knows thisâ€¦).
