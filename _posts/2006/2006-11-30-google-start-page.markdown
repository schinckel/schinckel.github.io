You can now have Google Start Pages for Hosted domains. I've found one bug - my calendar on my start page doesn't reflect the entries that are in it. And I can't find where to report this bug...the link that should work gives me an error saying that page isn't within the pages for hosted domains, or something. It will be cool to be able to have calendar, inbox and ToDo items on the one page, though.
