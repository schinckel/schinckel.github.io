I ran out of Espresso Grind coffee last week, and, not having enough money to buy anymore, went without until the cashflow had fined up a bit. Rather than drink the posh that passes for instant coffee, I went without. And it was horrific. I didn't really realize how badly I need a coffee in the mornings until I actually had my first coffee in some time this morning. And immediately I felt better. So, it seems I am totally addicted to bass, um, coffee. Caffeine is something that is quite unusual in my body: I can have a coffee right before bed and yet drop right off immediately, but if I go without in the mornings, I am my normal, grumpy self. It's not until I have the drop of Java that I become a shadow of a respectable person. Anyway, whilst the cashflow is still looking shaky, it turned out I had enough on my Hudson's card to grab a bag of freshly ground good stuff. And I'm sure my students will thank me.
