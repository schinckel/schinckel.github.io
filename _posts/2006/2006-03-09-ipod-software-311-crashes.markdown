If you have a 4G (Clickwheel) iPod, and you use it, don't install _iPod Software 3.1.1_. This version of the firmware causes the iPod to crash sometimes, even often, when going to sleep or waking up. You then need to do a force-reset (hold MENU & SELECT for 6-10 secs) in order to cause it to spin up, losing your place in a bookmarkable file, and possibly play counts for other tracks. I downgraded (using the Restore feature from _iPod Updater 2005-09-23.app_), and haven't had a single crash since.
