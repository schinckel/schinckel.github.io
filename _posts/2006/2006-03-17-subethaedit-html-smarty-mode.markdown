I've never been really happy with the HTML-[Smarty][1] Mode file I downloaded for [SubEthaEdit][2]. It's okay, but it loses the syntax styling on [HTML][3] elements, and doesn't really do that good of a job styling the Smarty parts. So, I've spent the last couple of hours hacking it to make it a bit better. I'd forgotten how hard it is to examine and understand regex codes, but I'm getting there. It's too late, and I'm too tired to finish it, but it is already better than the original. â€¢ And then I go to the SEE website, and see there's a newer version. Luckily, it's still missing a whole heap of functionality. That's a new project for me to work on then. My mode isn't quite ready for human consumption, but I'll keep working on it.
