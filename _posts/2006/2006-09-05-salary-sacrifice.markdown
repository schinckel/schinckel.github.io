I've had a loan laptop on more than one occasion recently, and I quite liked it. I recieved an email with an advert for salary sacrifice the other day, and did a bit of research. I'd prefer a MacBook, but the group I got the email from weren't any cheaper than the Apple Education prices. Anyway, buying a $1700 laptop over 2 years would end up costing me only $15 per week, dropping down to $10 per week over 4 years. I'm due in a couple of months for a payrise of about this much, so I may do this.
