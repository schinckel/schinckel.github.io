And, we now welcome back our ADSL service. Good to see you again, big fella. 

> Test run on **05/10/2006** @ **12:33 PM** Mirror: **Wild Internet ** Test type: **ADSL** Your connection speed: kbps: **210.38** KB/s: **26.3** Mbps: **0.21**

Courtesty of [Oz Broadband Speed Test][1]. The only anomalies are that my static IP address Wild gave me seems to be wrong, and apparently I connected at 12:18 this morning, which I can't have, as the modem wasn't connected then! And the connection might still be a bit flaky - it seems to be dropping out every now and then.
