I'm an intolerant person, at times. I despise lazy spellers, inappropriate punctuation, and meaningless drivel (unless I wrote it). So, imagine my consternation when I perused a missive on a Whirlpool forum: 

> my-subi writes... > billee, > just whimmed you, pls check your inbox, ta. no probs, going there now.

Now, there's two things wrong with this picture. The first is that billee would have been notified of the whim (WHirlpool Instant Message) upon logging in, so there is no need to post a message like this. I can let it slide, as it's possible that billee might be checking the forums without actually logging in. However, there is no need to reply that (s)he is "going there now." It's probably going to take longer to type in that message and press _Send _than it is to click on the link that takes you to the whimbox (I just made that word up!) What a crazy waste of bandwidth. Writing a message saying that you have been sent a private message, and then replying that you are about to read the private message. Almost as crazy and pointless as some guy blogging about how annoying it is when people do stupid, pointless things.
