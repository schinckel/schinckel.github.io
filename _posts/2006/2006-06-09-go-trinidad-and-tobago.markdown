The World Cup is upon us again, and whilst I am not the world biggest soccer fan, I love jumping on bandwagons. Two years ago I got right into the European Cup, and drew Portugal in the sweep at work. They made it to the final, where the guy who drew Greece (a Greek, incidentally, but that's a given at my school) wanted to split the winnings 50-50 regardless of who won. I chose not to, and Greece won, meaning I missed out on about $60 or so. Oh well. This year, I'm fairly sure I won't get that opportunity. See, I drew Trinidad & Tobago in the sweep. They are playing Sweden first, and are also in a pool with the UK, and Paraguay.
