The last few days has seen _extreme_ weather in Adelaide. 42Â°C for 4 days in a row. And this at the time we decided to:

  * Chop down the 13 Cypress Pines along the side fence.
  * Remove the old air-conditioner and brick up the cavity.
  * Knock down the old greenhouse.

Mum and Dad were up from Naracoorte to help us - Dad manned the chainsaw and they brought with them a 14" Ã— 6" trailer, which we loaded up with Cypress offcuts. We kept the trunks, as they are pretty straight, and we'll use them for garden beds. Anyway, we got all of that done - and a lot of it in shorter time than anticipated. The cutting down of the trees only took about 4 hours, which is lucky, as we may not have completed it otherwise. It was so _damn_ hot. I took a heap of pictures. One day I'll get around to posting some more.
