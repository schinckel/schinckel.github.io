I've been fiddling with Writely lately, and think it's very cool. Online, shareable word processing. Even handles (relatively well) both revision control and concurrent editing. Not quite as well as, say, SubEthaEdit does live multi-person editing. Today, I also came across this: [Google Spreadsheets][1].
