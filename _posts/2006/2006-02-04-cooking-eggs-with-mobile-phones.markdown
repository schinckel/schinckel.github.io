[Boing Boing: HOWTO cook an egg with two mobile phones][1]

> HOWTO cook an egg with two mobile phones This site claims to provide instructions for cooking an egg by placing it between two live mobile phones

I'd _very_ much doubt that this would be much different than just placing the egg right next to the antenna of a single phone when making a call. After all, it's not like mobile phones connect _directly_ to one another, is it? Don't they connect to a base station?
