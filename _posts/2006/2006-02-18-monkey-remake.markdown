[BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | Monkey magic casts spell in Asia][1] Hot on the heels of the news of the Dark Crystal remake, comes this, an announcement that a Japanese company is redoing Monkey!, the tale of a priest and his companions, Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy as they travel across China to India in search of the Buddha's Scrolls. It's one of my all-time favourite shows (I now have the complete set, including the dozen or so that were never shown on Australian TV). I've read the original book, or rather a translation, written by Wu-chÃ¨n Eng, and can sagely say (that was supposed to be safely, but I like the typo) that the original TV series was true to the story. I hope the new one is.
