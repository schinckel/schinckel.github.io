The radio was tuned to 91.9FM last night, while I worked away on the computer. By worked, I mean played, but that's irrelevant. So, I listened to the same songs over and over again, and I'm okay with that. Because, at least one segment was where listeners voted, so they must just be choosing those songs, hey? And, amazingly, the #1 and #2 songs both had 20% of the votes each, and in fact it came down to _one vote_ between the two songs! So, imagine my surprise when, tonight, as I have a short break from WoW to make Chai, that on comes the stupid Nova bimbo, and there is _one vote between songs #1 and #2 again_. Now, this cannot possibly be true. And, what's worse, is it's totally meaningless anyway. I mean, both songs get played, right? What's the point in having all of this fuss over it? If it were a difference between songs #5 and #6, and they were only playing 5 songs, then it would make sense. Or, if the loser were to never be played again. I don't get it. Why do Nova feel the need to lie to their audience, just to try to get them to vote for songs in a crappy, meaningless competition?
