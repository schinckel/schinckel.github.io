Whilst most of the stuff in WoW update 1.11 is great, there are a couple of things that have come to my attention as being problematic. The first and most obvious is the global LookingForGroup chat channel. It has meant that everyone in every zone can see every LFG from the other zones. This alone is bad news, as it makes the traffic level in this chat too high. But it gets worse. People have started using this channel as a trade channel, as they now get access to everyone, everywhere. It means that most of the time, people will now be forced to turn this channel off. Secondly, and only obvious to Druids, is the subtle change that has been made to flight paths - you can now only fly to Rutheran Village out of Moonglade, wheras before you used to be able to pick a flight path, and chain out of Moonglade.
