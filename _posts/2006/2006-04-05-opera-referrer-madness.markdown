I was testing my site in [Opera][1], and because I have some code in the template that shows the referrer as obtained by the browser down the bottom, I can see where I came from when I visit my site. Imagine my surprise when I came across the following: ![][2] I haven't been able to find out anything about this in the Preferences, but it seems so bizarre! Needless to say, I hadn't been there (this was in fact from a page that was loaded by typing in the address!). A refresh on the page removes this from the referrer, so this value must be generated by Opera when a referrer doesn't exist. I wonder if it's a sideline business for them. Not happy, if it is. For the search engines: the address is _http://quegu.topcities.com/online-poker-rooms.html_ I'm not linking it, deliberately.
