[creativepro.com - Putting Your Best Blog Forward][1] Smith Jackson, over on creativepro.com, has written a nice article on how and why to blog: it's fairly heavily pointed towards Blogger, but there is a mention of Blogsome, and more importantly, my site is the example of a Blogsome blog linked to. I only noticed because of a referer hit, so, welcome to all of my new visitors who came from that direction! If you are keen on signing up with Blogsome, please do so. It costs nothing, but be sure to sign up in the [Forums][2] too, and have a look at some of the features (and caveats) of this service. I'm a very happy customer with Blogsome.
