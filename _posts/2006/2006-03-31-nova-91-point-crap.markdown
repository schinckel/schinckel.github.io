We've had [Nova 91.9][1] playing while we've been painting the last couple of nights. Some of the music is okay, but last night I noticed they are playing exactly the same songs as the night before. That's okay - the young folk today are so whacked out on drugs (prescription, as well as recreational) so they probably don't remember that these songs were on last night too. After about three hours, I realised they were playing a whole heap of songs _for the second time that night!_ I mean, come on. You needs to smoke _shit-loads_ of drugs to forget the songs that played in the last three hours. And it wasn't just one or two, but more like all of them. Are the programmers so lazy they only program half a night worth of music, and just play it all twice? I want that job!
