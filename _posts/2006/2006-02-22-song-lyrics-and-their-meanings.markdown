With no radio in the car at the moment (I broke the automatic aerial again, and it's too expensive to justify buying a new one just yet), we tend to put 6 CDs in the stacker, and listen away. At the moment, we have: 

  * Diesel • Short Cool Ones
  * Sheryl Crow • Tuesday Night Music Club
  * Coldplay • Parachutes
  * Diesel • Solid State Rhyme
  * Frank Bennett • Five O'Clock Shadow
  * Dido • No Angel

I know, I know, it's a pretty _Early 90s_ set of discs, but, hey...  Now, the interesting thing is that we are sick of Frank Bennett already - he did a couple of albums that are covers of modern songs, in a Lounge/Swing style. We must have listened to them too much when we first bought the CDs! The big surprise for me was just how much I love Sheryl Crow. 

I remember her being big with _Tuesday Night Music Club_ back when I first started Uni (1993), and I still knew most of the words to most of the songs upon first listen. I tend to over-analyse song lyrics, after listening to too much Paul Kelly and Ben Folds, and people of that ilk, who really pack a lot of meaning into their songs, so this may be a bit over the top, but there's one aspect of one of Sheryl Crow's songs that made me look at the whole song a different way. 

_No One Said It Would Be Easy_ by Sheryl Crow, from the album _Tuesday Night Music Club_ (1993): 

> It's obvious the trouble we're in,  
> When your father pulls up in a Mercedes Benz.  
> He says he just happened to be in the neighbourhood.  
> But before he leaves he slips the Landlord the rent.  
> You say, "It's just a question of eliminating obstacles."  
> As you throw your dinner out the kitchen door,  
> You say, "I know how you try,"  
> "But honey, let's eat out tonight."  
>
> \[Chorus\]:
> No one said it would be easy,  
> But no one said it'd be this hard.  
> No one said it would be easy,  
> No one thought we'd come this far.  
> 
> You can't seem to ever fold up a shirt.  
> I bring it up and you think I'm a jerk.  
> But I think we're here to stay,  
> I can't imagine it any other way.   
> 
> \[Chorus\] 
> 
> Sometimes I wonder who he's picturing,  
> When he looks at me and smiles. 
> 
> \[Chorus\] 
> 
> Oh, and look we've come this far.

Without being too anal and looking at the whole song, I'm just going to talk about the chorus. Pretty straightforward: 

> No one said it would be easy, But no one said it'd be this hard. No one said it would be easy, No one thought we'd come this far.

I originally (probably correctly) thought that the last line had the meaning of: 

> No one thought we **would** come this far.

But think about the song, and how the meaning changes if you instead think about it as: 

> No one thought we **had** come this far.

Suddenly, the song changes meaning. In some ways, it makes more sense. Instead of it being a statement that _"We've done better than anyone thought we would,"_ it becomes _"We've come too far to quit: no one else thought we were as deep into this relationship as we are. It's too late to get out now, not without losing too much."_ And the final line: 

> Oh, and look we've come this far.
