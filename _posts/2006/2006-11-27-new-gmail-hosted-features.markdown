I noticed a few new features in the Dashboard for Gmail for Hosted Domains. Domain alias - it's now possible to have multiple domains using the same mailboxes. That is, you could have `company.com`, and `company.net`, and have users only have ot have one account - all mail delivered to `username@company.net` can be forwarded to `username@company.com`, and each user you set up on `company.com` has the `.org` address too. Much neater than having a heap of forwarding addresses. Better sign-in URLs - to access hosted Gmail, I had set up a redirect from `http://mail.schinckel.net` to `http://mail.google.com/hosted/schinckel.net/`, but it's now possible to have a proper CNAME record. This works for mail, and calendar. I'll have to set this up, as soon as I can get to my domain registrar (it's blocked at work). Cool. Two features I like a lot.
