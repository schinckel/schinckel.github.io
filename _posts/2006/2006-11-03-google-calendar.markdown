I'm going to start playing around with Google Calendars. My Touch Football admin team have been using Google Docs (was Writely) for collaborative documentation, and I need to reorganise my life. gCalendars look cool, and I might be able to sync with PalmOS. Hopefully both ways, although even just one way might do.
