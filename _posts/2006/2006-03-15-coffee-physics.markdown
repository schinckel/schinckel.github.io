[rentzsch.com: I don't understand Coffee Physics][1]

> **Fresh hot coffee:** yum. ** Day old coffee:** yuck. **Cold coffee** (day-old coffee that's been stuck in the fridge): yum.

I've noticed this too: but even more so, if I brew some fresh coffee, it's great. If I brew it, pour it over ice and put fresh cold milk in there, it's great. If I put it in a thermos flask, and drink it two hours later, it's still _nice and hot_, but no longer _nice_.
