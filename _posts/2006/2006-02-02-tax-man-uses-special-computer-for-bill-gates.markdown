[Tax Man Uses Special Computer for Bill Gates - OSNews.com][1]

> Bill Gates has revealed that the US taxman cannot process his tax return on its standard computers. Speaking to a Microsoft conference in Lisbon, Bill said that his fortune was too large and pendulous for the tax office computers. Apparently they just run screaming when they see his bulky dossiers. The tax office have had to splash out on a special computer that can accomodate all those 00000000s without squealing like a pig.

Yeah, they use a special computer. It's called a Macintosh.
