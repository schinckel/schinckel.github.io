> ...that's Dreamz with a Z.

I went into this film with an idea in my head as to what it would be about. There has been a significant amount of advertising, and, to be honest, it looked good. With not being a real fan of the _Pop Idol_-type shows, but knowing more than enough about them to understand even the most in-jokes, I felt I was fully prepared for whatever the movie threw at me. I was surprised. Whilst the film was poking fun at the popularity contests that are the current crop of New Talent shows, it went far deeper than this into it's satire of American family and political life.  With a title sequence that had music reminiscent of a civil war flick, I was unsure as to if I was in the right theatre. If it wasn't for the teaser where we see just how shallow and self-absorbed Hugh Grant's character is, I would have asked around, or even ducked out to see the number on the door. And the opening scenes, with Dennis Quaid took a few seconds for me to adjust. He is clearly a parody (and a very close one!) of the current US President. Whilst at times he looks a bit like George W. Bush, as soon as he walks, talks or moves, he clearly becomes the kind of person you clever Americans have elected again.

The lack of understanding of current affairs, the ease by which he is pushed around by his staff, the cluelessness as to what to say, Quaid certainly hits the nail on the head. It seems like it's way over the top, but this nagging feeling inside me keeps saying _this is exactly what Bush is like behind closed doors_. A spoiled little boy who was pushed into the presidency by his parents and advisors, and doesn't really know what he's doing. Someone who doesn't realise the laughing stock he is internationally, and possibly even nationally. Perhaps, if Bush read the papers, then he might not be so likely to follow the whims of his handlers quite so easily. And the characters involved more directly in the show are magnificent as well. Mandy Moore in her second real satire movie (she was in a rather anti-fundamentalist christian movie some time ago) simultaneously manipulates the population and her family and loved ones. She certainly is shaping up to be the next anti-establishment sweetheart.

I'm not sure who this movie is aimed at. If it were my audience, then I'm sure it would be a hit. Those people that couldn't stop watching _Farenheit 911_, loved _Three Ki_ngs, and were somewhat scared by _Wag the Dog_. But Mandy Moore seems to still have a younger, less politically astute or aware following. And the lack of impression that this is actually a political satire in the advertisements seems to indicate that it is a film for the fans of _American Idol_, a chance for them to laugh at the show they love and themselves for loving it. Don't get me wrong: this is not a film that was funny all of the time. There were plenty of moments that just didn't ring true. However, it kept me entertained for most of the two hours. Certainly looks a whole lot more fun than _The Da Vinci Code_.
