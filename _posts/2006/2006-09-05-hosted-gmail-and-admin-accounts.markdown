I've got hosted Gmail for both my domain, and my partner's. It's really good - much better than mydomain.com's crappy email forwarding service, which seemed to fail every odd month. However, there is one caveat to take notice of. If you create a new account, and set it all up, including allowing POP access (which requires logging in, and agreeing to the ToS), everything works fine. If you upgrade this to an Administrator account, you need to log into this account again, and agree to the admin ToS, else you can no longer download mail via POP. Took me a while to figure this out...
