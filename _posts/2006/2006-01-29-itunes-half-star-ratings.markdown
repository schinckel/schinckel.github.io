I recently [performed an experiment][1] to examine how iTunes handles 0-100 ratings - the result was "Not very well." Something made me repeat the experiment, but this time with just tracks rated 0,10,20,â€¦,90,100. That is, no stars, half a star, one star, and so on. For those playing at home: I just used a Smart Playlist where `name contains 0`, and used the procedure in the previous linked post.  Here is a graph showing the results. I've annotated it in a couple of places. ![][2] The first thing to notice is that the yellow line shows the relative frequency of tracks played with whole star ratings, excepting no stars. As expected, this is a linear relationship. The interesting thing is that the zero-rated track does not lie on this line. Instead, the half-star track does. This becomes even more interesting, when considering this: one-half star is the only one where the frequency differs from the rounded down full star rating. The moral of this story: rate your songs as 0-5 stars, or Â½-star only. Don't bother about the other valuesâ€¦
