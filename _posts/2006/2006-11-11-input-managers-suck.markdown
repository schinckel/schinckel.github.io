I had a problem some time ago with Stickies stopping working. It loaded up fine, but I couldn't add any text or data to any notes. Then, I downloaded Gmail notifier, and got the same problem - I could type in a password, but not the login name. This was too annoying, so I did some hunting around. I found the following Input Managers in my Library (both these apps were working fine on other user logins): 

  * Amendment
  * HotService
  * Menu Extra Enabler
  * Smart Crash Reports
  * StepMenus

I disabled the lot of them, and it all works fine now. The moral is, Input Managers can screw stuff up. Stuff in other programs.
