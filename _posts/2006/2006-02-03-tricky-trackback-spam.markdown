I noticed the following Comments, or rather Trackbacks, on a post to my blog today. As you can see from them, it is over a year since I posted the article, but the thing to note is that one comment seems to respond to the other: ![][1] That's all well and good, until you look at the post: ![][2] It has nothing to do with the comments! That twigged me that it was Spam. And the fact that the URIs all point to the same domain. As does another Spam Trackback I received seconds after starting this post. _techmp3.org_ is going into my Spam filterâ€¦
