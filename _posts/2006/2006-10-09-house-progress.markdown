I'm in school holidays at the moment, and I've been rather busy doings some more of my house renovations. The floors are all oiled, and just awaiting the oil to harden before it's possible to put furniture on them. They look great, Jaq did a really good job doing the oiling. I also bought a heap of timber for the architraves and skirting boards - 90x12 meranti. This is thinner than normal skirting boards, which tend to be 19mm. Before I started putting them in, I had a bit of wiring to drop. Because we are having an island computer and work bench, all of the cables need to come up through a trapdoor in the floor. There was already a power point installed there, but I needed to pull some ethernet, phone and USB cables through a conduit. These then needed to be terminated at either end with sockets, which has all been done. With the cabling done, including dropping cable from the ceiling for the telephone connections, I was able to start on the skirtings and architraves. I began by cutting some skirtings for the front corner of the lounge, where there were some fiddly bits that needed to be cut, before I discovered that I am much better off doing all of the architraves first, and then measuring the skirtings to fit. Thus, the major part of today was spend cutting, sanding and priming the upright portions of the architraves for almost all of the doorways in the house. Excluding internal doorways on rooms that haven't been sanded, or finished yet. I've been using an airless spray-gun, and have had fantastic results. Tomorrow I plan to finish painting these, and put them up. Measuring and cutting the top sections of these will be much easier with the uprights in position. Then it will be skirting time again!
