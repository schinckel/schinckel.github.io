Listening to the new podcast by the ever-present Dan Benjamin and the effervescent Merlin Mann today reminded me of the one Mac OS X service I wrote, that I use almost daily.

It allows me to right-click on the filename line in a python traceback, and have the file opened at that line in Textmate. If the file is part of an already open project, it will open in the project window (unless it is open in another window, in which case that may pop to front).

Fairly simple stuff, and should be easy to extend for other traceback/output types.
