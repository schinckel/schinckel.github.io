Well, my iPad 2 arrived yesterday. Loving it.

But that's not what this post is about.

At work, one of our products is a thumbscanner system. I was discussing with our CEO the other day how the best way to have this in a unit was, and ideally an iPad or other tablet would be best.

The issue with the iPad is that you cannot just connect any hardware to it.

But then I remembered how some people had connected all types of USB hardware, including in one case a USB-ADB adaptor and an old, old keyboard. All you need is one of the iPad Camera Connection Kit thingos.

Guess I'll have to get one of those, and see what I can manage to get it to do...
