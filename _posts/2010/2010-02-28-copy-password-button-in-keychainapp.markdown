I don't know if this is new or not, but I haven't noticed it before. My normal workflow for Keychain.app and finding a forgotten password (ie, my Twitter one to put into a new app) is to open the password entry, and copy the value.

Today, I noticed a Copy button at the bottom of the window:

This still requires you to enter your keychain password to authorise the copy, but saves a step or two.
