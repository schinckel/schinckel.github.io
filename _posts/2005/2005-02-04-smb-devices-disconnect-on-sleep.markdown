That title pretty much sums it up. If you have an SMB server mounted, and you put the Mac to sleep, then the server is no longer mounted when you wake it up. Windows XP does not have this problem. Windows XP also mounts all servers it can find, removing the need for hacks like creating a mount script and putting it into your LoginItems.
