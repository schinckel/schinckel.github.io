Well, it didn't seem to completely fix it. Ages ago, after reading some book (called something like ["How to do Everything with Your Palm (TM) Handheld, Third Edition" (Dave Johnson, Rick Broida)][1] I stuck some tape over the Graffiti area, and I think this was causing (or contributing to) the problem. Since some of it was almost under the lip surrounding the screen, it was a little hard to remove. Almost all gone now, and the problem seems to be gone. Or nearly, anyway.
