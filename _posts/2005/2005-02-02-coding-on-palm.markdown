I don't write too many blog entries on my Zire (thanks to Jason, I'm not game to call it my Palm), and I just remembered why. It takes ages to enter data, and the error rate is too high. I was just trying to write a program in python (to run at home - I need to reinstall it on my Zire) and writing commas in particular is quite difficult. I might get around to buying a keyboard, or maybe just a laptop! I kind of like graffiti, but I wonder what the Palms with a keyboard are like. Using a retractable pen with the tip up is more comfy than the stylus.
