Yesterday afternnon, as I was on the way to the physio, I bumped into some old students of mine from a previous school. I chatted to them for a few minutes (Hi Bree and Steph), and was about to head off to catch my bus, when some random derelict man came up to us and said something. Now, I didn't understand a word he said, so I just responded with a "Look, I'm sorry, but I really have to go now", and turned towards the girls to make my goodbyes. And the guy punched me. Hard. Luckily, it was only in the arm, but I didn't see it coming, and I'm glad he didn't hit me in the face.
