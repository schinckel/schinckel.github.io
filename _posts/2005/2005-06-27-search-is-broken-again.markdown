I know I fixed the Search box in my sidebar, but it's broken again. I'll work on fixing it. Do'h! Update: it isn't broken, just not working how I'd like. It treats all entries as though they are surrounded by double-quotes, for example, searching for Connections Blogsome returns no hits, even though there are posts that have both of these words in them.  Whoops! Searching for that will now bring up this post, since those two words now appear in that order. Swapping the order of those words and searching will not find any posts...unless I wrote Bl*gs*me C*nnecti*ns somewhere, with the * replaced by o... Update 2: Now it seems to work. I did put a request in on the forum - I wonder if they fixed it...that was quick!
