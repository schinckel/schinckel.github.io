I've noticed a few abusive comments on various posts, and it struck me as interesting as to the general form of them: 

  * They are always anonymous, or pseudo-anonymous (kala@kala.com, god@heaven.net).
  * They always include lots of swearing.
  * They almost always lack proper capitalisation and punctuation.
  * They don't actually make a decent point.

I am actually happy to have posts critical of stuff I have written, as long as they actually provide useful feedback. I don't really want to have to turn moderation of comments on, I'd rather just remove comments that are totally inappropriate (SPAM, not adding anything useful to the discussion, etc), but if I get too many abusive comments, I may just have to...
