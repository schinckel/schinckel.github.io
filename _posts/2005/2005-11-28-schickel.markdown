One of my students today told me she had seen a poster for a band named after me. I did a little research (they played at Flinders Uni last Friday), and came up with this poster: ![][1] As you can see, it's pretty close. You can read about this band over on [Music SA][2]'s [Schickel][3] page, or [the Official Schickel Website][4], and even listen to a track. It's not too bad, actually.
