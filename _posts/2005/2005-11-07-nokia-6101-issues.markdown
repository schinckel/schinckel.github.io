I'm not having any real issues with my new phone, but these are the things I'd like to be able to change: 

  * It'd be great to be able to Sync with my Mac Address Book.
  * Camera shutter sound is very loud. Will need to disable it. [Done.][1]
  * PTT button is a waste of space. Would like to remap it to something else.
  * Need a blank operator logo. Had one for the 6610, and it was great. [Done.][2]
  * Front screen is lower in colour depth. Images look bad.
  * Some photos don't transfer across properly - they cannot be opened when copied to the phone.
  * Memory isn't very large (&lt;3Mb).
  * The Optus image on the mini screen when it's open sucks.
