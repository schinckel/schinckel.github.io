I can't use iTunesMusicStore (I live in Australia), and I don't listen to podcasts (dialup connection, besides I'd much rather listen to something from my Classical Music collection on the train anyway, chills me out nicely...), so I don't need either of these in the Source list under iTunes 5. The setting for disabling the iTMS has moved to Parental Controls, and there wasn't a Disable Podcasts one before, but there is now. I used to use the arrows that appeared for searching my library, but the functionality of this seems to have vanished under iTunes 5, so I'll leave it off for now.
