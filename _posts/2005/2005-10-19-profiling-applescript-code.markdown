This looks promising. Shark is a tool that can be used to profile code. I haven't done any serious profiling since some python script I was working on years ago on BeOS. Daniel Jalkut has a nice post, [Shark Bites Script][1] up on his blog, on how to use Shark to profile AppleScript code. Since I've been doing a bit of AppleScripting lately, and I have some code that is in serious need of optimisation, this might be worth a second look.
