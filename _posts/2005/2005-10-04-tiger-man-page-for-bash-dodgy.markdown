I recently upgraded to Tiger, and just yesterday I noticed some strange behaviour from [ManOpen][1], a great little tool for viewing man pages outside of a Terminal. Most man pages still work okay, but `openman bash` results in a long load time, followed by a crash. Every time. `man bash` still works fine. I might have to look back into the piping through Preview solution I was using a while ago. â€¢ Okay, there is a new version of [ManOpen][1] available. I'll just use that.
