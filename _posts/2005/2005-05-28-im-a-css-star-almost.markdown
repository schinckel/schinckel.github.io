I've played around with CSS for the last couple of hours, and have finally got my RSS/RDF links to be rendered like icons (with a border and so on). It took me ages to figure it out, but I was only able to change the background colour, until I removed the `<li>` tags from the links - that was overriding the ability to change border and text colour. I then spent a couple more hours trying to make the same thing happen for the Search and Post Comment buttons, before discovering that Safari, and Camino, don't support changing the look of form buttons. And I'm not going to bear using IE to test it under...I'll live with the images I've made (for now). What would be cool is to make all of the elements of Connections work in CSS - like the top and bottom bits of the sidebar boxes, and so forth. Well, the bits than can be made by CSS, anyway.
