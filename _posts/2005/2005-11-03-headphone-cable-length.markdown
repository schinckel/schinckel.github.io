I really like my headphones I use for my iPod. I [blogged][1] about how good they were back in July, but I've decided there really is something I don't like about them. Basically, the cable is too long. If I just plug them in, and put the iPod into my pocket, the cable hangs down to my knees. The weight of the cable at this length means that they are almost pulled out of my ears, and don't feel comfortable. If I wrap the cable around the iPod, it's much better, but I have to ensure I get exactly the right number of loops, as either the cable is then too short (and is pulled out of my ears if I turn my head), or is still too long. And having the cable wrapped around the iPod means it's harder to get into my pocket, and harder to control when it's in there. (I've discovered you can change the volume through fabric, as well as skip tracks). I'm considering buying some of the Apple branded in-ear phones I saw in the AppleCentre the other day. I might just try replacing the plug with another one, and shortening the cable, first. All I have to do is find a nice looking 3.5mm plug, now...
