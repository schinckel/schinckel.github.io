I just tried to sign up another screen name for aol: one without the @mac.com bit, and I found a bit of a hitch. Check out what Camino and Firefox render the page as:  ![AIM signup page under Camino][1] Compare this to how it appears in Safari: ![AIM signup page under Safari][2] Made it kind of hard to complete!
