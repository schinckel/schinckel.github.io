I've posted before about crap features of Word. The biggest bug, IMHO is the handling of objects (images, text boxes and the like) that are near a page border, and the Layout style is _Square _(or others, other than _In Line With Text_). When you move the object too close to the top of the page, it jumps up and sticks to the top of the page. Here is the Text box on my page. ![Before Moving Text Box][1] When I press the up arrow (keyboard) with the Text box selected, it jumps up to the top: ![After Moving Text Box][2] You cannot place it closer to the top of the page, without it being right at the top of the page, and outisde of the border, and over the header. This is bad, bad stuff.
