There seems to be some sort of a layering bug with Interface Builder - I notice it sometimes in development builds of iTunesRater: ![Itunesraterbug-2][1] As you can see, some of the widgets, sorry, views, are partially obscured. Sometimes it is worse than others, with all of the fwd/play/rev buttons covered. Sometimes it is fine. I generally have to just play around shifting different views to the front to get it all okay. Needless to say, it looks fine in Interface Builder.
