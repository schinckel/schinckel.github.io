I bought a new phone yesterday, and was partway through the process of sending all of my contacts from my Palm Zire through to the new phone (a Nokia 6101), when I noticed that the contact details were not current. I'd just imported a whole lot more contacts into Address Book, and modified a fair chunk of the rest of them, and these changes weren't reflected on the Zire. As it turned out, one of the System updates I'd done recently had updated iSync, and in doing this it removed the Zire from the synching devices list. Because Missing Sync doesn't run iSync unless there are devices there it needs to sync with, and with Missing Sync/Palm Desktop you don't explicitly run iSync either, I had no idea this had happened. Running iSync manually fixed the problem - it ran a little helper that re-added the Zire to the devices list. Of course, now I have to re-copy all of the contact I'd already transferred. Grr.
