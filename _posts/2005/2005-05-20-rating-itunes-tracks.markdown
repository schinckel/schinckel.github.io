I wrote iTunesRater because I wasn't happy with only having six possible ratings for each song - I have 5665 songs in my iTunes Library, and this isn't a fine enough grained distribution. I'll be honest, at times 0-100 isn't enough! I also wrote it because I wanted a window always open that can be used to rate tracks easily as I listen to them. My Party Shuffle grabs tracks from an Unrated playlist, which is every song with a 0 rating. (I use this as the base, and songs I hate get a 1-10ish rating. Because of my setup, where a server contains all of the songs, and multiple people can add tracks to this location, and every now and then you need to import the folder containing music, removing a track just means it would be added again later). Today, just out of interest, I looked at how many songs are in the Unrated playlist. 4472. That means I have only rated about 22% of my music. I could short-cut it a bit, and rate according to album, but I don't usually like every song on an album. And lots of times, I don't know the names of songs, I have to wait until I hear them. If I had an iPod, I might rate more, but then it would only be a 0/20/40/60/80/100 rating again. And I'd have to sit on the train with my iPod in my hand, and I like to read on the train.
