[Boing Boing: Human cannonballs][1] Great timing on this one: there is a Human Cannonball happening at this year's Royal Adelaide Show. Apparently they do a test where they put some sandbags weighing the same as her (yes, her) into the cannon and test-fire. But some joker left them out in the rain, and the weight was much more. So they test-fired, and then when they really fired her out she overshot the net by 25 metres and had to go to hospital. That's why it's exciting, isn't it? Because deep down, you hope she does hurt herself...
