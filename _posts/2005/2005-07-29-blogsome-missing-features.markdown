I've been playing around with my template files under Blogsome, and have come across some limitations - I'm not sure if they are limitations of WordPress Mu, or Blogsome's installation. 

  1. No Page Template. Without page templates it's impossible to make Pages display a particular way, without writing the bare HTML code yourself. It's also not possible to implement Smarty Tags in pages without a template file.

(I'm sure I had some others to add to this list.)
