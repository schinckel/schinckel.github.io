I had possibly the worst cup of coffee I've ever had the other night. "Le Bon", in the southern (station) end of the Adelaide Railway Station Underpass, sells coffees for $2.20, which is much less than most other places. But, you do get what you pay for. This was worse than instant coffee. And, it was so hot it burned the crap out of my tongue. Even then, I could still tell just how putrid this was. By that stage, I was on the train, so I had to hold on to a full cup of woeful coffee for 20 minutes, and once I forgot just how bad it was and took a sip. Don't ever buy coffee there. Ever.
