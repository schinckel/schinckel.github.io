This isn't really a full review or comparison, just a few quick notes. I downloaded the demo version of iMediaView Pro, and ran it. I let it import all of my iPhoto library, and was fairly disappointed it didn't automatically albumize them according to my iPhoto albums. I must say I don't like the interface nearly as much as iPhoto's. iPhoto is pretty much a great program, except it's dog slow whenever you try to do _anything_. But it's simple to use, and really has all of the cataloguing features I need right now. I just use a Smart Playlist to list every photo that doesn't have an album, and create a new album each time I import photos, and add them all to that. Now that iPhoto has folders, I can have a level of hierarchical organisation. And iPhoto has built-in capabilities to view photos by date of creation. If only it wasn't so. damn. slow.
