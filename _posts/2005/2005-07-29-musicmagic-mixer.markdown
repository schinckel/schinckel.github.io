Found what could be a useful tool today. [Predixis MusicMagic Mixer][1] According to the website, 

> The MusicMagic Mixer is the ultimate music library power tool to create dynamic and interesting playlists, or mixes. MusicMagic automatically analyzes your music collection. Analyzed songs are used to build custom mixes for hours of listening enjoyment.

Basically, it (apparently) looks for songs that are similar in some quality to the one(s) you choose. I don't know how long it will take to index a 6000 track library, so that might be a nice test for it... I'll download and test it out tonight.
