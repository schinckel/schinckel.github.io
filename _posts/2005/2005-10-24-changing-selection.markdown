I've got an interesting little challenge. I need to be able to programmatically change the document selection, as in the text that is selected, not a select box or anything like that, using JavaScript. Basically, I want to repeat the effect that appears on the Google Adsense site, where selecting in a textarea selects the contents of that text area. But I want to do it with just a random element. It's easy with a TextArea, but I want my element to maintain it's lovely formatting. I'm not actually sure I can do it. With IE, I can set it up to copy the text to the clipboard, but not select it.
