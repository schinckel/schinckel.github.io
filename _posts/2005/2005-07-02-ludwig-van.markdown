The BBC has been offering free downloads of the BBC Philharmonic performing Beethoven's Symphonies as a part of their Beethoven Experience. I finally finished downloading the entire set. I also leeched (using [realdump][1]) the complete Sonata Cycle, as performed in 2003 by Artur Pizzaro. The BBC website doesn't allow resume transfers on downloading, so I had to have several tries at some of the files. And a couple of the Sontatas don't seem to be all there - but there ain't any more on the server.
