An interesting point I just discovered in _The Hacker Crackdown_: Apple used the FBI in the early 90s to find a leak or leaks - someone who stole code about QuickDraw - and effectively dealt with it internally. No charges were laid against the person who published the details, only the employees/contractors who stole the code. Compare this with the recent legal action taken by Apple against that guy from ThinkSecret, or MacRumours or wherever. Whether Apple has taken action against the original source is not obvious, but clearly action is being taken against the public 'reporter'. Perhaps the current ease of publishing such information to a wider range of people, who can actually make use of the data is responsible. Or maybe, you've changed, Apple...
