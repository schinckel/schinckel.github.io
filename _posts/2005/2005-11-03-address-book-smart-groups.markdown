Smart Groups in Address Book are crap. You are limited to less than 20 options. And Related Names isn't in them, so I can't do a lot with the data I have, in terms of Smart Groups. I need to be able to say: 

![][1]

`People who (are in Group CSTA Database) and (Related Names: Referee > 0)` Or, even simpler: `People who (are in Group CSTA Database) and (Related Names: Gender is Male)` I can get away with `(Card contains Male)`, but this will also pick up anyone who happens to have `Male` in their name. At least it doesn't pick up Females, that's a start. Otherwise I'd just have to have a `does not contain Female` clause. However, the biggest kicker is not being able to refer to groups. I'd like to be able to have lists that get people who are in a particular group, but also have some other attribute. Oh, and I suspect that you cannot search using Spotlight, as this would require seperate files. Oh for the joyful days of BeOS, where people files existed, and you could just add extra attributes, as you chose. And then use queries (which, by the way, are much faster than Spotlight searches!) to find what you want. And it had the ability to create really complicated queries, really simply. And modify them easily to get exactly what you want. â€¢ While I'm on bitching about Address Book: I just looked through all of the Package Contents, and the HTML exporter seems to still use font tags. Ugh!
