I bought a proper razor on the weekend. One of the 'old school' (I hate this term now, it's been corrupted by the youth. Any type of Mobile Phone, no matter how old, is 'old skool') razors, a double-edged safety razor. No shaving rash. Closer shaves. Might have something to do with the cream I bought to, but it's nice. Even makes me look forward to shaving. Almost. Well, consider this a plug for the Shaver Shop. Transform Yourself.

Seriously, the guy who served me was excellent. Didn't try to sell me the most expensive razor or cream in the shop. I think he knows the value of patience, knows that if I am happy, I will come back, and buy stuff from him again.
