(http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000073036833/ "UK professor concludes: cellphones don't cause gas station fires"]: He studied all 243 gas station fires from the past 11 years that were supposedly sparked by cellphones and determined that not a single one was actually caused by a handset. The actual cause of most of these fires? Static electricity, which is what everyone who actually knows anything about this stuff has been saying all along. via [Engadget][1].
