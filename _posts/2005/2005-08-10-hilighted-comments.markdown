I've noticed a couple of blogs that hilight the comments made by particular users, mainly the blog owner, but in one case there were two writers, male and female that had blue and pink comment boxes respectively, and everyone else had another colour. I might implement this for another blog I'm working on, to do with a Touch team I'm Assistant Coach of. (South Australia Mens Open). I'll also probably implement it here, at least for testing purposes.
