[RegularJen][1] has a [post][2] about funny personal ads: it reminded me of this joke. _(Before I start, some background. Elizabeth is a 'satellite city' of Adelaide, Australia; and it is known for having a high number of unemployed residents. It can easily be replaced by whatever town/city/locality you want to bag.)_ 

The Joke: A welfare auditor noticed an anomaly in the benefits being claimed by a particular Elizabeth single mother: she was claiming child payments for 19 children. he thought he'd better go and visit her - 19 isn't a totally unbelieveable number of children for one mother to have, but seems pretty high. So, he visits her house, and talks to her. 

"I'm sorry, but I really need to see all 19 children, and proof that they are yours."

"Yep. No worries. I'll jeest git them in 'ere."

She then proceeded to stick her head out the back door, and at the top of her voice yelled out: "Waayne! Geet in here!!!" _(Wayne can be said with a very thick 'Ocker' Australian Accent.)_ 

A whole bunch of boys of varying ages then began filing into the house. Confused, the inspector asked "So, if they are all called Wayne, how do you tell them apart?" 

"Oh, they've all got different surnames!"
