I read about some guy's aim to [poach an egg][1]. It's much simpler than this: just boil some water in a saucepan, with a little white vinegar added. When boiling, stir the water gently and break the egg into the pan. Use a slotted spoon to keep the shape, and to remove the egg when done. When you get good at it, you can try more than one egg at a time. (Not many words here due to Dvorak layout.)
