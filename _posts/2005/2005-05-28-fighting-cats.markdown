Stupid cats fightin' outside our window again. Seems to be happening most nights now. I went outside, and they were literally right outside the bedroom window. If it gets to be a problem, I may have to kill them. Seriously, when I went out with the torch, they just stopped, mid fight, like schoolkids. And walked away. "We weren't doing anything, sir." (I've disabled Trackbacks & Pingbacks on this post, it has been getting hammered lately.)
