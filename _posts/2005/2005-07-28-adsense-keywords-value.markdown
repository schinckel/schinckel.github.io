I was reading up on the WordPress SEO scandal from late March/early April, and a comment I found in it got me thinking about keyword values. I then found a page that offers to sell a list of keywords, that can be used on Overture (a competitor to Adwords/Adsense) to receive high dollar values per click. (I'm not going to link to it, to protect you, loyal reader...) They ask for a payment of US$99. Bargain! (Note sarcasm). I'm not suggesting I'll get into any SEO stuff, or try to scam Adsense, I tjust thought it was interesting to see how people do make money. Of course, it reminds me of the books you can buy telling you how to make a million dollars. I think the best way to become a millionare is to write a book telling other people how to do it, and sell 50,000 copies at $20 each.
