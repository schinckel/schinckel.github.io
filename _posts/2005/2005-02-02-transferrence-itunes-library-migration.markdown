I'm putting my whole iTunes Library, and all of my iPhoto pictures, and the various movies I've collected onto my NSLU2. To shift the iTunes library, I just changed the library location in the Advanced Preferences, and then Consolidated the Library. I'm hoping I'll be able to do exactly the same with Jaq's and it won't actually have to copy the files across, as they will already be there. It will be interesting to see how clever it is. It takes a couple of hours to transfer the many gigabytes of music I've encoded, so hopefully it won't have to be completely redone. Either way, it will keep all of my ratings, and so forth. My tip for sharing songs from a library between multiple users - just point all of the iTuneses at the same location for storing the files, and make sure all of them are set up the same in terms of organising. When one person adds songs, the others just need to drag the folder/disk onto the iTunes Library icon in iTunes, and only the new files will be added. There are occasionally issues when someone changes an album or track name, but iTunes seems to cope pretty well most of the time.
