I received this Spam yesterday:

Dear Kristen, Clearly, you haven't read either the post to which you refer, nor the other posts on this site. I am not running a Professional Nail Gun website. In fact, the only reference to a Nail Gun is bagging the company that supplied it. So, no, I won't be joining your affiliate program, and I won't be clicking on your link.
