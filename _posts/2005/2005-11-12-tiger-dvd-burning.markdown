Something is either wrong with Tiger's Finder DVD burning, or Xbox Media Centre's DVD reading. Any DVDs I burn from a Burn Folder in Tiger will not work properly on the Xbox. The disc name is reported fine by Xbmc, and the first track will play if the disc is inserted (and autoplay is turned on), but no tracks are reported as being there by the browser. Toast-burned DVDs work fine, and all burned DVDs work on the iMac itself, or on a PC. Very frustrating in that I don't do this often enough to remember, so I keep having to re-burn discs so I can watch them on the Xbox. I can't wait to finish the house and have my home network all hooked up again. Having to burn a movie back to CD/DVD just to watch it is very frustrating... (All of my DVDs are packed away in storage, and I cannot be bothered opening up boxes to try and find the one I'm looking for).
