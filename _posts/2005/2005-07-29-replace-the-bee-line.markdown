In the latest issue of Express, the TransAdelaide Newsletter, the main stories discuss the new tramline extension: Passengers on the new tram extension will travel free, replacing the Bee line bus. The 99B also services the West End, and is much more frequent than the 99C. If they do kill the whole Bee-line, they'd sure better increase the frequency of the City Loop!!
