Things I'd like to see in Blogsome: 

  * The _XMLRPC_ bug fixed. I want to be able to post from ecto again.
  * More quicktags. I've written some code to enable `<abbr>` and `<acronym>` tags, as well as `<` and `>` signs.
  * The ability to have `md5()` as a Smarty filter.
  * An _RSS _feed from the forums. Not strictly Blogsome, but would be cool. Done!
  * Preview in Editing window uses template (or part of template?)
  * The GMT Offset bug fixed.

A lot of this stuff should be able to be merged back into the WP/WPÂµ tree - the XMLRPC bug has been already, for instance. But I understand that the Blogsome team aren't keen on upgrading the software if it is going to break something.
