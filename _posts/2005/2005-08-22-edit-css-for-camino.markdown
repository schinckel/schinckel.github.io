I love the EditCSS extension for FireFox, and have been using it to fix problems with my own and others' pages for a while now. What I just found is even cooler: [Web Development Bookmarklets][1]. Including an EditCSS bookmarklet, and lots of others. Well worth the visit: I've stuck all of them in a folder in my Bookmarks Bar, and now I'm happy as larry!
