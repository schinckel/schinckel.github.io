Not that this has ever come up, but there is an AppleScript out there somewhere that allows you to type <code>%_who</code> into Adium, and it returns a list of people you are chatting to.

Naturally, it was sub-standard, and I have improved it.

Features mine has:<ul>
	<li>Don't display the name of the person who you say this to</li>
	<li>Display "I'm not chatting to anyone else." if you aren't</li>
	<li>If the person you are chatting to can handle HTML in chat (Jabber, AIM), then list display names of the people you are chatting to, with each person a clickable link that will open a chat with that person</li>
	<li>Otherwise, display a list of people you are chatting to, with the type of chat listed after each name</li>
</ul>

I've included the old one if anyone was interested: you can get it by typing <code>%_who</code>.  Mine uses <code>/who</code>, and you can download it from <a href="http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=1896">Adium Xtras</a>.
