I've noticed a whole heap of blogs that use the "X hours after the fact" tagline as part of the comment. I've tried to implement this under Blogsome, but I'm struggling. I know I need to use the following: `{ comment_date }` and `{ the_date }` The problems I have encountered - Smarty doesn't seem to like subtracting values that are dates, and I can't seem to get them as numbers... Anyone done this?
