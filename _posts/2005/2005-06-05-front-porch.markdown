Jaq spent a bit of time this weekend (while I was at the Greenhill Road Touch Fields) emptying out the planter boxes on the front porch, sealing the post that supports the roof, and then we filled the gaps with concrete. Then, we planted some plants! A heap of [Snake Plants][1] (_Sansevieria trifasciata)__,_ and a couple of [Agave][2] (_Agave attenuata_). They were all plants we had from the old house, and they look great.
