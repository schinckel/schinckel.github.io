I have _Osteitis Pubis_, an inflammation of the pelvic joint, due to poor muscle tone in my abdominal area, and overuse from Touch. I haven't played a game of Touch since February, and have been going to the Physio, doing my exercises (occasionally). Last night, I decided to have a light run in my Social team (Arab Steed Pornstars). But I am unable to run 'lightly', and I wound up diving all over the place to score and make touches. So, I am a fair bit of discomfort this morning. I guess I was a little premature in my return to sport...
