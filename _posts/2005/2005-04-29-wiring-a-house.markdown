I'm renovating my house at the moment, and I'm going to run some cable to various places. Unfortunately, I can't do as much as possible, as the box gutter in the middle of the house precludes access to the northern roof space. Still, I will run cable to as much as possible - since I need to replace some floorboards, a fair chunk of it will be under the floor, including some floor mounted power points, cat5, and maybe some a/v cables.
