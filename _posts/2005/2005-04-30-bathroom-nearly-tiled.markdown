Ray has been tiling the bathroom the last couple of days. It's starting to look good. Here's a before and after: [![Dsc00051][1]][2] [![Dsc00018 1][3]][4] [![Dsc00021][5]][6] [![Dsc00052][7]][8] I've spent my time sanding walls, and then re-plastering, then sanding. The areas below the front bedroom windows have been heaps of work, but they are starting to look great. And then tonight, Andy started to paint the ceilings - undercoat/primer first, of course. Since we have to move in on Wednesday, we are going to be busy painting over the next couple of days, and I have to go back to work on Monday. And I'm not sure when we'll get around to polishing the floors.
