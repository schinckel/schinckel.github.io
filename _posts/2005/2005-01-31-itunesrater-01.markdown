As much as I like to bitch and moan about AppleScript, AppleScriptStudio isn't too bad for creating simple applications. In a couple of hours, I just wrote a simple stand-alone application that monitors the current song playing in iTunes, and allows rating to occur, independent of the iTunes window. It also allows for a larger range of values as the rating, rather than the iTunes 0-5 stars. The tick marks are on the slider so you can see what the current rating will be in terms of the iTunes display. Features: 

  * Automatically updates display from iTunes when song changes
  * Automatically updates iTunes rating whenever it's changed
  * Allows for more flexible rating than basic iTunes, and most other programs capable of changing ratings.
  * Unobtrusive, can sit in the corner of the screen while working.

Limitations: 

  * Ugly icon

I take no responsibility if this toasts your iTunes library - I use it with mine, but your mileage may vary. Here's a little screenshot, and the archive is [iTunes Rater][1]. (Only Version 0.2 is still available!) [ ][2][![Itunesrater][2]][2][ ][2]The AppleScript code is IMHO interesting:
