I've included the ability to rate the previously playing song in 0.7 When iTunesRater knows the current song, and the previous song, it will activate a checkbox: Show Previous. Clicking this button will open a drawer with the details of the previous played song, which can be rated. I seem to have made the whole thing run a bit slower now, I'm going to refactor everything at some stage. But not right now... Edit: Whoops! Big bug there - if a track doesn't have artwork, iTunesRater spits it bigtime...fixed now though. Get 0.75 from [iTunesRater0.75.zip][1].
