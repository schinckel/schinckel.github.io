This weekend was the SASSSA/TouchSA Touch trials. I coach the 15s Girls' team, and we had a great turnout again. More than 40 girls, with most of those of an extremely high standard. We've selected a squad of 20 girls who I'll train over the next month or so, before choosing my final team of 14 and shadows. I'm looking forward to the trip to Darwin in mid-September...
