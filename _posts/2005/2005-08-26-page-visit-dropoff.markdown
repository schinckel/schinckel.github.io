I don't obsess over my referers, much. It's interesting to see what pages people have visited, and where they have come from, but I don't write the stuff on this site because I'm trying to make myself heard, or popular. It's more of: "Here's some information I've come across: if someone else is searching for it and I can help them, that's all good!" Having said that, I have had days in the last month or so where I have had over 400 page visits. Many of those are to the one [post ][1]I wrote on Sudoku, ages ago, but they still keep coming. Even though I don't actually provide much information in that post! I even had a day, a month ago, that had 690 referers, although a big chunk of them were actually some spider, as they were all DIRECT referers, and all seemed to be accessing weird URLs. More recently, I've discovered the [Gvisit ][2]page, and have been able to see my most recent visitors locations, on a Google Map, which is very cool. I've even thought of making a category link, a home page link, and so on. But that seems like it might be too much work. Today, I noticed I only had 24 referers at around 2:30 (ACST: +0930), a time I usually number around 150. I thought, "Hey, there's something weird going on here!", and looked at the monthly view. 125 yesterday, and 174 the previous. Prior to that, _each day had around 3-400 referers_. I'm not sure why my traffic has suddenly halved: my Google Page Rank is a fair 5/10 ([Boing Boing][3] has a Page Rank of 8, [Blogsome][4] 6)
