Okay, whilst Optus are blocking Port 80 Traffic (That's a Webserver to most folks), port 81 seems to be open. That is, I could access `211.29.1.x:81`. They have also left open port 8080, which is interesting, as this is the default alternate http port. What I need to get working now is rinetd, or some sort of port forwarding so I can point port 8080, or another port, at my NSLU2 webserver.
