[Gates Sells 12M Microsoft Shares - Forbes.com][1]

> Bill Gates has sold about 12 million shares of the company's common stock in a series of transactions over a five-day period, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Perhaps Bill Gates has decided Microsoft is in trouble: offloading shares while the price is high, knowing that the share price is about to drop. 

> Other filings showed that Robert Bach, a Microsoft senior vice president, also sold 30,000 shares on Aug. 2. Other Microsoft senior vice-presidents, namely Kevin Johnson, Eric Rudder and Jeffrey Raikes, sold some shares, but their transactions remained below 1,000.

Maybe all of the Microsoft execs are dumping shares on the unsuspecting public. 

> Gates still owns more than 1 billion shares of Microsoft, which are worth about $27.8 billion at Friday's closing price. 

Maybe not. Gates sold around 1.2% of his shares. It's like me selling...no hang on, I don't own any shares. In anything...
