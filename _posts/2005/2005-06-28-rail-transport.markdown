Why is it that when I'm on time, or early, the train is late; but when I'm running late, the train is on time - or early? I had to run to catch it again. I'm so unfit. For someone who used to play or ref 12-odd games of touch per week, I've lost heaps of fitness. What is up with the 2 girls who catch the train from Lynton to Torrens Park? It's a 15 minute walk!! Do yourselves a favour, save some money & walk. And get some better sunglasses. A week or so ago we had some rain - it seems to have cleared up a bit now - and I got off at Mile End, as I was on the later train and didn't have time for a coffee in town. The underpass had a bit over an inch of water in it, and there was no other way off the platform. I had wet feet that day. As I catch the train I have ample time to ponder, and passing through the Keswick railyards fills me with sadness. I see dozens of old rail-cars. Do they still work? Is there some sort of rotation happening, or are they no longer used? Have we passed through the golden age of rail? Will governments see the long term benefits of having a comprehensive rail network? Or will rail fade, as they close down station after station? What would be required for TransAdelaide to re-open the stations like Millswood & Clapham? How would they know there was a demand for these shut-down stations, if they aren't operated? Maybe lots of people would use the train from these zones, but don't because it's too far to walk to Lynton or Torrens Park. Was it really such a drain on resources to have these stations open at all? Surely their costs to upkeep would be insignificant compared to the overall costs of the rail network.
