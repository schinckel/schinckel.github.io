[Cellphone Dieting : Gizmodo][1]: 

> The process is pretty low tech: take a picture of the food you eat, send it to a dietician, and then they send back a video message telling you... ...These kind of personalized/techno services should be making things interesting in the next few years. I could see a personal trainer doing this, as well...

There's an ad doing the rounds on Australian TV at the moment that reminds me of this article, but I can't remember what it was advertising. It had a guy who sent a picture to a personal coach, or something.
