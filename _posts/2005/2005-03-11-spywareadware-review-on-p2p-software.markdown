I read the [document][1] referenced on some blog I read (Sorry!) and noticed how glowing it was of LimeWire. Now, I seem to recall LimeWire installing several things on my PC when I installed it - and one of them still exists in the Add/Remove software section. Then I noticed the line down the bottom of the document: 

> **Disclosures** _This article builds on paid consulting I conducted for LimeWire. I thank LimeWire for their willingness to let me share my findings with the public._

Hmm. I'm not at all suspicious.
