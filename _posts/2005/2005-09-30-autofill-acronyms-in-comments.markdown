I created (or rather modified) some code to allow for quicktags, so commenters can have **bold**, _italic_ and `code` text, amongst other features. I also added in `abbr` and `acronym` tags, just for fun. Today, I made this even more kick-ass. If you select some text, and click on `abbr` or `acronym`, and there is a valid acronym in the list in the script, it autofills the definition in the dialog for you. I got rather excited after doing this. But, I'm a nerd. • **Note:** The seperate Quicktags toolbar is not supported. Please use the full toolbox script, or hack it any way you like. The remainder of this post remains for posterity only. • Anyway, you can get the button version here, and the CSS link version here. Remember to Right-click and download, rather than just clicking on them.
