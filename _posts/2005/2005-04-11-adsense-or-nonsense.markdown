I use Google AdSense as a way of trying to make a little spare cash from my blog. I've only just started, and I'm still figuring out what ad settings work best. I just changed from a list of searches/hits to an Ad. Imagine my surprise when it came up with a Gay Blog Site ad: and I have no idea how it came up with this. I am not gay, and I haven't written anything about homosexuality (before now). Of course, the irony is that I'm probably going to get more of them now, even though I've filtered that one...
