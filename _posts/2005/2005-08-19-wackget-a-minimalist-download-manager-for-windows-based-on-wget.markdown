[WackGet - A minimalist download manager for Windows based on wget][1] Hmm. Should be easier to write one of these for Mac. 

  * Can download all links in a page that point to files that might be interesting (.zip, .sit, .mp3, .aac, .mov, etc).
  * Can just download all links within the selection.

Actually, writing a Service to do this would be great.
