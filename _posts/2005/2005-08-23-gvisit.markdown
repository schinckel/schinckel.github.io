Now this is cool. Go to [Gvisit][1] and you can register, and get a one-line JavaScript that can be put onto a web page, and their server will be able to tell you where your visitors are coming from! My last 5 visitors came from: 

  * New York
  * Bern
  * Seattle, Washington
  * Melbourne, Victoria
  * Adelaide, South Australia

I'm guessing the last one was me ;) The free service will only track the last 20 visitors, the paid-for one will do up to 100. (Thanks to [Jake][2] for this one)
