Creative Commons licenses are great - from a reader's point of view, they've allowed people to publish, and me to read a whole variety of stories I might never have otherwise come across. Cory Doctorow is one example - he writes daily for [Boing Boing][1], but has also written a whole heap of short stories, many of which I have on my Zire, and I read one every now and then. I really enjoyed _Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_. In fact, I managed to throw the term _Whuffie_ into a [comment][2] the other day. Anyway, I came across this tonight: [a short story by Charles Stross][3]. Loving it, so far.
