I'd forgotten this was how I'd removed the Operator Logo last time: I registered with [SMSpup.com][1], and Australian Web-based SMS service. If you register you get a couple of points, and you only need one to get an operator logo. Then make a custom operator logo, with no background, and make it so it is just whitespace (a single space works well). Then choose your provider, and then click **Preview**. You may need to re-choose the provider before clicking **Send**. All done. When you receive the Operator Logo, it will default to being active, masking the **YES OPTUS** that was there, or whatever your provider displays. If you ever want it back: _Menu âžž Settings âžž Main Display âžž Operator logo âžž Off_
