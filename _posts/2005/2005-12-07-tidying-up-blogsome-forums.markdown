I've been keen for a while now to go through the [Blogsome Forums ][1]with a bit of a broom - there are lots of duplicate threads and topics that could be pruned, and some stuff probably belongs in different forums. The recent server troubles have generated a flurry of posts, some of which were total duplicates, and some of which were even in the wrong forums. I think for instance, that a lot of the stuff that is in FAQ should be moved elsewhere, and have this as a place where a really well thought out list of questions, with complete answers, is listed. Perhaps this forum can be limited to a subset of users, and they can create new posts here with answers from other questions asked throughout the forums. I'd love to hear from some of the other users about this idea, particularly people who might be interested in helping with the writing of actual FAQs. I wrote a significant rant/rave in the forums about this issue... it will be interesting to see if it gets any replies.
