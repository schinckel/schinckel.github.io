I just started reading ["Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life" (Steven Johnson)][1] today, and then find a link to his [blog][2] tonight. Synchronicity! After reading through most of the stuff there, and subscribing to his RSS feed so I don't miss anything, I finally found a link to a review he wrote of the Jim Carrey movie [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind][3]. I've just read, in creating the links that it was a Kaufman film (ie. [Being John Malkovitch][4] / [Adaptation][5]). I may have to rent it and have a watch. So, here's SBJ's article: [The Science of Eternal Sunshine - You can't erase your boyfriend from your brain, but the movie gets the rest of it right. By Steven Johnson][6]: http://slate.msn.com/id/2097502/ iTunes: _Your Disco Needs You_ from the album "Light Years" by [Kylie Minogue][7]
