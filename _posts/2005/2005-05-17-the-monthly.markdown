Hmm. Original name for a monthly magazine. Even cooler if it comes out with a frequency other than it's name. I probably would have never come across it, but a copy of the first issue, May 2005 was sitting on the counter I went to in Hudson's this afternoon. (And I would not have kept it, had they put a decent amount of froth into my flat white. Flat White. Flat. Not one-third froth! Get with it guys! I know I should tell them, but I prefer venting later.) So I started reading it. And, I must say, I quite enjoyed some of the articles. I haven't finished it yet, but I liked Don Watson's piece on rural values, and the article on the smoke ceremony that followed the death of the aboriginal chap on Palm Island. And (although I'm only part way through it) John Birmingham's take on Ipswich and John Howard. But, I'm not convinced that _Suicided_ is a word, Chloe Hooper. According to [Google][1]: Did you mean: Suicide And to [Dictionary.com][2]: No entry found for Suicided.
