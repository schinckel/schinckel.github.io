Central Scorpions Touch Association Mens Open had their first training session yesterday. I am the coach. I've coached plenty of Womens and Girls touch, and the occasional boys team, but this is the first time I have coached a team of Real Men (tm). It is kind of intimidating (and I probably need to stop worrying about stepping on feelings), but I'm quite looking forward to it.
