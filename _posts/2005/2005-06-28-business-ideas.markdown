At lunch on Sunday, I had to do my usual trick of re-fixing Ray & Joan's digital set-top box. Not that anyone had stuffed it up or anything, but it must have been reset at some stage, and all of the 'extra' channels, which are just duplicates of the first, had reappeared. This in itself was a simple, 2 minute job, but it gave me an idea of a possible business venture. Setting up people's entertainment units & systems, and teaching them how to use them. I often have to do similar tasks at both my parents', and Jaq's parents' houses. Most of the time it's reconnecting hardware, but sometimes it's optimising settings. I wonder how much I could charge Joe and Jane Average to do this, and show them exactly how to use their stuff. I could do DVD/TV/STB installations, PC usage, and even digital cameras. Another thing I could do would be CD library -> MP3 conversion, and DVD -> AVI/MPEG conversion (for Xbmc, PVR, etc setups). I'm even thinking of a name: GeekGuys. www.geekguys.com.au - I'll have to do a search and see what similar services are available.
