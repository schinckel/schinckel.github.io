I only just noticed this one today. Depending on the file format you add as an attachment to Mail.app, it's possible to resize the image directly from the Compose window: ![][1] This works with JPEG, PDF, PNG and possibly others. The toolbar will only appear if the image is large enough to bother with a potential resize, however. And the most interesting thing is that a resize changes the format to JPEG from PDF. And, you can set the popup menu to a value, and each new image you drag will be resized as per the popup. Sometimes, you can revert back to the original file format by choosing Actual Size, but at least once this didn't work for me.
