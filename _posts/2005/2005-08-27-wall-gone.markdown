Well, today was a busy day. Beginning at 8:45, we removed 2.5m of the wall between the kitchen and the lounge. The cavity doesn't go right up to the ceiling, but is at about normal door height. Apologies to everyone, but this is avery photo-heavy post.  To start with, we drilled three holes in the wall, well above where the cavity was going to be. Then we inserted Ã˜40 steel bars through the wall, and supported them with upright adjustable stands. We used a large piece of timber to keep everything stable.

(Well, Jaq is anyway). As you can see from this last set of photos, there were quite a few bessa blocks removed! Oh, and we got the smaller wall between the lounge and dining rooms ready to knock out as well.
