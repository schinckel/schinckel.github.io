When I was trying to find the name of the song they use in Classic FM for a theme tune, I discovered a bug in iTunesRater - it only checks the title of the song, not anything else. So two songs with the same title played one after another won't necessarily change the iTunesRater display. Of course, attempting to fix this has caused some other issues...
