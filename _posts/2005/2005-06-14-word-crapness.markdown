Microsoft Wordâ„¢ 2002 (10.2627.2625) has an extremely crap 'new feature'. When you press the Delete key with a block of text selected, nothing happens. If you notice down in the bottom left corner, Word asks if you want to delete the block, requiring you to press the Y key. Talk about crap interface design. Having to press two keys to delete a block of text, when there is a perfectly good undo system in place if you accidentally delete the wrong text. How often do you accidentally delete a block of text, anyway? And why not make the consistency of having to press 'y' when you go to overtype a block of text? Or press Enter when a block of text is selected? I'm now going to have to use the latter, rather than delete. Microsoft, you guys suck.
