**Note:** the best place to get the Template, as it looks now is: My [Template][1] Page. This is automatically updated. To set up Blogsome to use Connections as a theme requires some serious editing of the Connections theme files. Luckily for all of you, I've done this. What you do need to do first is download the actual theme from wherever you can find it. Try [Vanilla Mist][2]. Then, upload all of the images (making sure you change the top.jpg if you want, to whatever image you want there) using the Upload tab of your dashboard. Unfortunately, you cannot FTP to blogsome's server, so you will need to upload each file seperately. Note: if you change the top image, make sure it is the same size. Leave the bar at the top there - that's where the nav menu needs to go. I have added a couple of images: [post_comment.png][3] and [search.png][4] that also need to be uploaded. You then need to put all of the contents of the following files in the correct place using the Manage/Files tab of the dashboard: [Main Page][5], [Style Sheet][6], [Posts][7], [Comments][8]. Depending on your browser, you may need to save these files - it might try to render them, and therefore make them rather useless. (I'm talking IE here!) **Note:** The most recent version is always available at [Connections Template][9]. That should just about do it. I would suggest you do some edits to make things a bit your own (maybe remove my AdSense code) but that's up to you. If you cannot fix any errors, [drop me a line][10] or leave a comment here. Good Luck/Happy Editing  Update: I've changed where the files are stored, and I've put the latest versions up there, so update away!
