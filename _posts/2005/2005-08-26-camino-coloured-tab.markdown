I opened [this page][1] in Camino, and found that the tab coloured itself blue: ![][2] Weird. I wonder if its a controllable thing, or a bug? **Edit:** Must be a bug, as opening a new page in the same tab kept the tab blue, and closing the tab and re-opening the same page didn't result in that tab going blue. Strange.
