I've finished the edits I wanted and needed to make to [Patricia MÃ¼ller's][1] excellent ([award winning][2]) theme '[Connections][3]'. I had heaps of hassles with matching up <div> and </div> tags, and according to the XHTML Validator, I still haven't got it completely right, but close enough for now! Also, (and young coders take note) Internet Explorer (Win) was not handling HTML comments the same way every other (read: real) browser does. Removing these comments, or uncommenting them, fixed the problem with pages not displaying blog comments and the sidebar. Finally, Netscape (Mac) doesn't display the "rap" image, nor does IE Mac display any images.&#160; If you are using either of these products, get Camino, Firefox, or just use Safari, dammit! Oh, and I wonder if anyone knows where the photo of me was taken!
