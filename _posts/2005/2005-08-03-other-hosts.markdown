I'm thinking about leaving Blogsome: I've been pretty happy with their hosting solution, and bugs tend to eventually get fixed, but there are two issues I can't continue to live without: 

  1. Posts posted via XMLRPC don't have categories set.
  2. Posts posted via XMLRPC have quotes and double quotes escaped, breaking stuff.

I've got an account set up on [http://schinckel.globbo.org][1]. I'll probably continue to post here until I get the template/theme set up how I want, and then move everything over.
