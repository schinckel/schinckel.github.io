I just listen to random music most of the time. But every now and then a weird series of tracks come up. The normal thing is that tracks that we currently have in the car CD player play. But this one tops everything. The Eagles, New Kid In Town comes on, and I switch over to iTunes Rater to rate it, as I like that song. Then I notice this: ![][1] The title of the previous song was "Johnny Come Lately", words that are part of the chorus of "New Kid In Town". Almost as spooky as the bit in Metal Gear Solid 2 where stuff starts going bunkum, and the voice says: 

> You've been playing this video game for too long. Turn the console off now.

This occurred at around 4am, so I was totally freaked. It was right, I had been playing the game for too long. Although this was actually part of the plot (trying to make Raiden(?) believe he is not real), I was convinced.
