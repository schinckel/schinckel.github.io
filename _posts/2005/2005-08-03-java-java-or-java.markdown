I have no burning desire to learn Java. I'm proficient in [python][1], did a fair bit of Pascal about 12 years ago, followed by some C, a touch of C++, and recently a whole chunk of AppleScript. Daily, I possibly spend more time coding for bash than anything else, except hand-coding HTML. I've recently started playing around with PHP and MySQL, and ages ago did a bucn of JavaScript. I'm not saying learning another language is not a good idea. I just wouldn't mind if the [three][2] [tertiary][3] [institutions][4] in my city didn't only offer the same language as part of their Computer Science degrees. Not that I'm seriously considering going back to University. It just might be nice to find a course that taught python, Obj-C, or C++, rather than Java. Still, it might be fun to learn it...
