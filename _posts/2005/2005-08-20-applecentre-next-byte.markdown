Over on DrunkenBatman's site, DrunkenBlog, he has posted stuff where buys have taken photos of Mac with one of his Desktop Backgrounds installed in Apple Stores. I did this in the AppleCentre Next Byte, Rundle Mall the other day. Here is my photo: [![AppleCentre Next Byte Photo][1]][2] If you look carefully, you can see I turned on the iSight, and got myself in the image, just. Oh, and BTW, I discovered that Preview does [this][3]. That is, it allows you to resize an image to a target file size.
