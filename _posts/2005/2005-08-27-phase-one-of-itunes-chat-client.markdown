I've started phase one of the iTunes controller bot: I'm downloading the jabber server for MacOS X. ` $ sudo port install jabberd ` Phase Two will soon be underway: I've also downloaded the source of a Python bot... more to come soon! Actually, getting the jabber server to work wasn't as easy as it should have been: I'm using a private jabber account on a server only I know about, but I'll post more stuff as I get it working. Python looks to be an easy way of getting the bot to work: it would be nice to be able to do it all in AppleScript though. I can't believe I just said that!
