I've been a member of the freecycle-adelaide list for a few months now - I've given away some stuff, and picked up a few good things, including a push mower. Recently, A Current Affair did a story on it, and now the list is filled with people asking for stuff. The moderator posted a message reminding everyone that you are supposed to only rarely ask for things, and must offer before asking for anything. I haven't asked for anything - I see it as a way to use other people's stuff they need to get rid of, not prompt someone to give stuff away. Anyway, I'm thinking about unsubscribing, as I had 78 new emails today, and 77 of them were either SPAM or \[freecycle-adelaide\] things. And not much there that was that interesting.
