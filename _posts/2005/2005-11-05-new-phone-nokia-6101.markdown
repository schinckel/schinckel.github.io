Well, my contract with B Clear and Simple finally ran out, so I ran out and got a new phone, and a new contract. Luckily, a few years back the Australian Government decided to make it possible to port your number to a new Service Provider, so I'm keeping the same one. And for some reason to get this legislation through, they didn't have to make up some bullshit about clear and present danger of terrorist threat on home soil... Anyway, the first OptusWorld shop I went to didn't have any 6101 phones, so I went to another, and they did. Took about an hour (or so it seemed) for all of the paperwork to be done. Then the guy said it would take about 4-5 hours for my old SIM card to stop working, and my new Optus account to be up and running. I wandered 100m down the mall, went into a sushi bar and unpacked my phone. Battery nearly fully charged, and SIM card already working! So, I really like the phone so far. Especially since the old phone was starting to have some issues: buttons weren't registering properly on a click, and so on. I'll write more when I've actually used it for some time.
