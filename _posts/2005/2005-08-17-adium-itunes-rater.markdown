I wrote a quick AdiumScript to rate the currently playing song in iTunes. Trivial. The only downside? Arguments to AdiumScripts need to be typed in using {} rather than (). I'm much faster at typing in () without looking at the keyboard than {}. I guess I'll have to learn. There are also scripts for quick-rating a track as 0-5 stars: `/rate3` will rate a track as ★★★. (That's three stars if you don't have Unicode!) `/rate{44}` will set a rating of two-and-a-bit stars. The AdiumScript bundle includes all of the scripts, and can be downloaded [Adium Xtras: Rate Current iTunes Track][1].
