We spent the first part of the first day back at school watching a short video about a Chicago Fishmonger where they throw the fish around, and have heaps of fun. We had to relate that back to our own employment within a school. I'm not sure some of the members of my group took it completely seriously. The best thing we came up with was _Curriculum is a Fish_. Make of that what you will. iTunes: _Take The Long Way Home_ from the album "Sunday 8pm" by [Faithless][1]
