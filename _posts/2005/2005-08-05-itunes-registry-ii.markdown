I uploaded my XML file last night, and it's analysed it, and given me some useful feedback. 

> You appear to like Chillout the most, with Wicked Beat Sound System your favorite, which makes sense, since they have the most playtime in this genre. Chillout is your favorite common genre, and you have more Rock songs than anything else. Honey is your favorite overall artist, but you listen to BBC Philharmonic the most. Jet ain't too bad, either. 

**Genres **22; **Artists **1,381; **Albums **2,050; **Tracks **6,039; **Total Time** 18.46 days **Last Played **_Cotton Fields_, by _Beach Boys _ **Playcount **6,498 **Total Playtime **19.54 days You can see what it's like now, by visiting [Schinckel's iTunes Registry][1]. I might make a script/program that checks to see if the computer is online, and if it is, gzips the XML library file and uploads it. That way, these would be updated regularly.
