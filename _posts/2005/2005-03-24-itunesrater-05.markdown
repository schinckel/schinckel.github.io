I've redesigned the User Interface for iTunesRater, making it more of a controller, and upped the version number to 0.5 I've also included the functionality of AutoRater - but the maxRate and minRate values are (at the moment) hard-coded to -5 and +10. I need to learn how to load and save preferences before I change this. AutoRate is also turned off by default. Anyway, it is at [iTunes Rater 0.5][1], and the source is [iTunes Rater 0.5 Source][2]. As of now, iTunes AutoRater is deprecated, since the functionality is all implemented in iTunesRater0.5 Next feature might be an image lookup, and apply (to single song and to all in same album).
