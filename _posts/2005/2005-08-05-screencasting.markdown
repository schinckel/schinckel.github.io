I am amused at the Ads that Google Adsense places on my site, and the one that has kept coming up recently finally got my attention, and I visited it. [![Screencast Adsense Ad][1]][2] Screencasting is actually something I would be very interested in. I often need to teach others how to do something, and the ability to add this into my website might be useful. Unfortunately for [Camtasia Studio][2], I use a Mac, so I will have to look for other software. And there seem to be some free ones out there worth looking at.
