Some time ago, I wrote a replacement script for the Quicktags that are present in the Blogsome backend. It seems that they have been implemented! You now have the ability to put `<abbr>` and `<acronym>` tags into a post, quickly and easily. Also, it's possible to get the characters `<` and `>`, without having to remember what they look like. Try it out!
