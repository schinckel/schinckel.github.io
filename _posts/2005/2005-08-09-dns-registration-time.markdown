It's nearly time for me to reconsider my DNS Registration - I went with a $9.95 Dreamhost annual price, under the belief it was $9.95/year for life, but this was only for one year. I don't use any of the hosting features, just DNS registration, address forwarding and mail forwarding. I'm looking for a cheap registrar who offers these things. Anyone know of any DNS Registrars that are cheap and good?
