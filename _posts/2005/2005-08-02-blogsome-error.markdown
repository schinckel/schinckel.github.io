When I went to my blog today to see if there were any new comments, I was unable to see anything. I received an error: 

> It doesn't look like you've installed WP yet. Try running install.php.

Clicking on the link had no effect. What you need to do is: 

  1. Login to your blog. Even if you cannot see the front page, you can go to /wp-admin/
  2. Edit any post from your blog. You do not need to make any changes.
  3. Save the post, and the database will have fixed itself.

It seems so be an annoying bug in the WordPress Multi-User code. It has happened before, and it doesn't seem to happen to everyone as anyone in the process of posting when the bug appears will automatically fix it without realising. I don't know what time it occurred at, whether it was when a visitor placed a comment, or what. But it seems to be all fixed now.
