With the demise of my phone, I was virtually a lost soul. Luckily, Jason had just upgraded his phone, so I now have his old one, on a long term loan. It's the same model as mine, but there is one notable difference. The vibrate feature is about three times as strong as my old phone. So now when I get a call, and the phone is in my pocket, I **really **know about it! It went off a couple of times on Wednesday night during parent teacher interviews, and it really tickled! Apologies if you called me during the time I was under a phone blackout if I haven't called you back yet. I will, probably on Monday during the public holiday...Yay!
