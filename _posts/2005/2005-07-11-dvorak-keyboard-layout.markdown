Back in the heady days of BeOS, I at one stage taught myself how to type reasonably well using a Dvorak keyboard. I've clearly forgotten most of it. This was typed (slowly) on a Dvorak layout. I am getting faster, and more accurate, though. Using the CLI program dvorak7min will get me back up to speed soon, I hope.
