I had to work today, which meant I didn't get to start working on the house until about 5pm. Jaq was around town doing stuff, so she didn't do anything before then either. Today I ripped up most of the skirting boards, and kept pulling nails and staples from the floor. Jaq continued with wallpaper stripping, until the machine exploded. Luckily, she wasn't holding it at the time, and was not injured. One of the walls we were going to remove turns out to be a solid wall. We still should be able to do something, but it will change our plan of attack a bit. You can see in the first photo below that there are bessa blocks under the wood panelling.

Also, I've drawn up the House Plans, in AutoDesk Inventor. This is only the floor plan, and doesn't show the different heights, but I'll work on those when I get the time.
