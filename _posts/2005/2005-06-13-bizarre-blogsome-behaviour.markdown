I just posted an update on what I've done to to make Connections work on Blogsome. When I did so, it crapped out my stylesheet and layout. Just having the info in a post that is normally only in the template files caused WordPress Multi-User to wigg out. And I didn't just have the text, it was all escaped and &gt;'d (I think I just created a new term, &gt;'d!!) I'll have to just have the files hosted somewhere else, and linked to again, I guess. Update: It was actually the Smarty Tags that were wigging out, or more correctly, the CSS code that Smarty thought were Smarty Tags.
