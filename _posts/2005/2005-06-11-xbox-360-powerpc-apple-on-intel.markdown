I just had a thought. It's relatively well known that the Xbox 360 will be using a PowerPC chip, since the development units are all Macs. But Apple is moving it's product range to Intel. Doesn't it seem bizarre that Microsoft is moving to PowerPC, while at the same time Apple is moving to Intel. Unless the Macintoshes that were the development platform are actually already running on Intel chips. Oooohhh...
