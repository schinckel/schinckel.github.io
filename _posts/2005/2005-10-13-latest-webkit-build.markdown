I've just downloaded the [latest WebKit build][1] of Safari, from the [Surfin' Safari][2] weblog, and great news! _Finally_, Safari/WebKit supports finding the selection in a TextArea. I can now use Safari in the WordPress Dash, and use the quicktags. I don't need to code my JavaScript for comments to ignore Safari... Yay! This post posted using Safari, and all tags put in by the Quicktags.
