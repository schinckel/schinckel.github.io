I like the term Googlebombing. The idea is that a heap of sites link to a certain page, using a certain term, and that page then ranks higher when people search for it on Google. There is one in progress for [online poker][1], so I thought I'd add to it. Hopefully, people will go to this, rather than one of the dodgy places that actually offer online poker...
