I have been using Jaq's iPod the last couple of days - mainly because when I am waiting at the Adelaide Railway Station, and at Lynton Station, I cannot get good enough radio reception on my phone's radio. So, I copied all of my Classical music onto the iPod, and I've been listening away. I'd like to be able to rate tracks on the iPod, but I don't really want to, for one big reason. I would only be able to rate them at 0-5 stars, not using the 0-100% ratings I use from iTunesRater. I wonder if it's possible to hack the iPod firmware so that rating occurs by a finer gradient?
