I really like Camino. It's pretty much like FireFox, but with a more Mac feel. However, with the latest feel, I've noticed the occasional lockup. I get the spinning beachball of death, and no response. I haven't found out what's causing it, whether it's a particular site or otherwise... **Update:** A second issue - not sure if it's a new one. If you have a File Selector open, and a currently loading page decides to ask for a cookie, and you have the setting of "Ask before accepting each cookie", then you won't be able to dismiss _either_ object, and will have to force quit. This has caused me to rethink my idea of Asking before accepting cookies.
