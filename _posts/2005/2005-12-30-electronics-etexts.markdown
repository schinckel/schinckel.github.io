I've been looking for a halfway decent textbook to use in my High School Electronics classes, and as yet haven't come up with anything that even comes close. However, I've just discovered a couple of sites that might have some pretty good info on them: 

  * [All About Circuits][1]
  * [Electronics Tutorial][2]

I'll have to examine them a bit - one of them looks like it might be pretty good to use for the whole course outline for the Year 11/12 courses.
