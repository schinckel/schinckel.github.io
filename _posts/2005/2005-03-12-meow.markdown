Using the program [Meow][1], it's possible to see what notifications different programs give to the system - things like changing the menu-bar, that the menu was activated, and in iTunes, that the song has changed. Yes, you heard right - there will be no need to poll the system every _n_ seconds to see if the song is the same! Or if the song is paused! Now I just need to find out how to discover these notifications, and act upon them.
