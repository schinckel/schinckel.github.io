I've been doing some study as part of my work: a Language and Literacy course run by the Department of Education & Children's Services (SA). I've enjoyed it greatly, in part because I am a pedant and love to pick stuff to bits. To that end, another document put out by DECS, XPress, had the following in an article on page 19, December 1 2005 issue: 

> **Henley HS remembers ... and learns** \[snip\] Henley HS teacher Sean Fletcher worked with an all boys Special Sport middle school class to __initiate__ and research the war, during which time students constructed a replica of an observation trench, researching its dimensions to make it realistic.

(non-heading emphasis mine)

And I thought the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand had something to do with the start of the war...
