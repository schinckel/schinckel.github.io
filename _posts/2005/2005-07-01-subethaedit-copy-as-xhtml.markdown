Man, this is cool. After reading about it on Fraser Speirs' blog, I tried _SubEthaEdit_'s **Copy As XHTML**. (â‡§âŒ˜C) It is extremely good. See: 
    
{% highlight python linenos %}
    #! /usr/bin/env python
        
    """A script for ecto that adds abbr and acronym tags to the text"""
        
    TODO = """
    Lookup on the internet for a list of acronyms/abbreviations?
    """
{% endhighlight %}
    

The only thing missing for me is the ability to paste this into ecto, and have ecto be able to edit it in Rich Text mode, rather than just HTML. (Oh, and I think my stylesheet is stopping the comment/string/keywords appearing in colour). *Edit:* No, it was an issue with double-quotes being escaped by a slash! I'm not sure what caused it, but it was annoying
