Thanks to Sam Deane, and his [Now Playing script][1], I have added the following functionality to iTunesRater. When a song with no Artwork starts playing, Amazon.com is contacted, and if the Artwork is available, then a drawer with possible artworks is opened. Eventually, when you click the Artwork you want, it will be copied to the track, (and all others from the same album). Now if only I can make it so it does this bit in the background - perhaps another script that gets called?
