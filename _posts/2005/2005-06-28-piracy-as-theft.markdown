I heard an interesting thought on the similarities between piracy of copyright material and theft. 

> No, I wouldn't steal some guy's Ferrari if it were left on the street, but if I were able to make an exact duplicate, without doing any damage to it, then I would. And what's more, I was never going to buy a Ferrari in the first place. They haven't lost a sale from me...
