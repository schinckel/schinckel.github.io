Whenever I listen to iTunes now, I have iTunesRater running, and attempt to rate tracks as I hear them. I have my Unrated playlist running through Party Shuffle, and have to rate each song before it ends. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to rate the previous song. I'll try to code this into iTunesRater....
