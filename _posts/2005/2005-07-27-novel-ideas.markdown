Of course, by this I mean ideas for my next novel, not NEW ideas. Biology: Removal of junk DNA as part of creating the perfect soldier. Switching on our tail gene. Black Comedy: Person who kills people for their annoying habits/actions. Phone ringtones, 8 items or less, driving slowly in right lane. Historical Fiction: Eighteen Hundred & Froze to Death. The year Summer never came. (1816).
