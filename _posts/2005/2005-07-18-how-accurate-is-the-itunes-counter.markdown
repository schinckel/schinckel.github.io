I got a [comment to a post][1] that had nothing to do with iTunes. Whilst it wasn't a particularly helpful or nice comment, I thought maybe I can answer the question I think he's asking. (Unless he's talking about the iTunes Music Store counter that shows how many songs have been bought for the latest contest...). Wach time you finish playing a song, the Play Count field is incremented, and the Last Played date is updated. If you skip a song before listening to the entire track, neither of these are updated. There are some scripts around for MacOS AppleScript that will update a Play Count and Last Played if you listen to more than a certain amount of a track. I could also add the same feature to iTunes Rater. But I don't really use Play Count and Last Played that often, anyway.
