iTunesRater 0.6 has been released. Saving prefs works a bit better now, but the only way to change the maxRate and minRate variables is through: `defaults write iTunesRater maxRate <value>` 
    
AutoRating is working, and the program now remembers the last state for the AutoRater. 

New feature is the inclusion of a preview of how the rating will look in iTunes, ie the number of stars. [iTunesRater0.6.zip][1] (Note, this URL is broken for the time being, until I get around to uploading it to a site that can handle zip files, not just 3 types of image file...)
