In case you haven't heard, Google has 'released' their IM system - it's just a Jabber server, though. There are a couple of review around, and I haven't read all of them in that much detail. It requires a Gmail account: I have plenty of invites if you want one, just [email me][1]. The settings you need are (I use Adium, your client's names may vary): `Account Type: Jabber Jabber ID: your.account@gmail.com Password: •••••••• Connect Server: talk.google.com Port: 5222 Security: Use TLS Encryption (if possible)` - I couldn't get a connection without this, some have said opposite. Others have said that any person with whom you have shared Gmail will be automatically added to your buddy list. I haven't had anyone added to mine, but then I don't really Gmail many people. I've also created accounts with the other IM players, you can find them under the [Contact][2] page.
