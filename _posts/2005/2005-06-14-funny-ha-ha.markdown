Funny or interesting things I've seen, thought of or heard during the last day or so. 

  1. I misread the colour of something in the hardware store yesterday - I thought it said Missing Brown.
  2. I thought I was going to be waiting for ages for the train this morning, as when I got to the crossing, I could still see the back of the last one. When I got to the platform, the next one was coming. If only the trains came that often all of the time. Oh, and the one I ended up catching was virtually empty. Not surprisingly.
  3. When my train was going through Keswick station this morning, there was a conjunction of trains, where all four were at nearly the same place at the same time. Different tracks, obviously.
  4. I misread _fortune cookie_ as _fortune wookie_. Okay, that one isn't that funny either.
