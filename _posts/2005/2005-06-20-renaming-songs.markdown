I had thought that renaming a track from one user of a shared iTunes library (where the files are shared, but each has her own library file, with ratings/play counts, etc) would cause iTunes to not be able to find it for the other users. But, I renamed "Tom's Dinner" to "Tom's Diner" (Suzanne Vega), and switched over to the other user, thinking I'd have to do the old _Find Track_ trick, but iTunes was smart enough to realise that the track it needed had changed name...and updated the library automatically.
