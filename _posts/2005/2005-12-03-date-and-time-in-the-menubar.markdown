[Date and time in the menubar | creativebits][1] Nice way to have the date in the menubar as well as the time, under OSX (possibly Tiger only). Saves having to move the mouse up to the top-right and click to see the date. Of course, this will affect anything else that uses the Medium Time setting, like ecto's Date view.
