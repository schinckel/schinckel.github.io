Those funny Americans and their love of banning books. Just one step away from burning them, really. Anyway, over at [Dose Magazine][1], I found a link to a [list of the 100 Most BannedChallenged Books in the US][2] (1990-2000). The ones I've read: 

  * The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier
  * The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
  * Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck
  * The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
  * The Witches by Roald Dahl
  * To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
  * Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes
  * Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
  * James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl
  * The Anarchist Cookbook by William Powell
  * Guess What? by Mem Fox
  * Lord of the Flies by William Golding
  * Carrie by Stephen King
  * The Dead Zone by Stephen King
  * The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain
  * Where's Waldo? by Martin Hanford
  * Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett

I'm amazed as to the number of Roald Dahl books on there! And _Where's Waldo?_.
