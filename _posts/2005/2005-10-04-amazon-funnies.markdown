I was hunting for some artwork for some iTunes tracks tonight (very nearly this morning), and I came across this page for the album There is a Way to Fly, by Coda. ![][1] According to this, people who listen to Coda are likely to be on drugs! Or maybe I just misinterpreted it: maybe Coda is an addiction I need to kick.
