I read every word in the first issue of [The Monthly][1]. I must say, having read it, and looking back, there aren't many advertisements in that magazine, it is mostly articles. And some of the articles were great! I hardly ever watch _Enough Rope with Andrew Denton_, but after reading the article on him and his interviewing techniques I may start to. If I can ever get my [ABC][2] reception better then the crap it is now. Speaking of the ABC, there was an article on how the culture of this great instution has changed over time, and how it may change in the future. And then in [the Australian ][3]yesterday, I read how funding has reduced the number of hours of local drama created to an all time low of 21. Twenty-one hours of local drama created in one year, by the corporation that once created greats like _Brides of Christ_, and _Love is a Four Letter Word_. I'm also looking for a CD, _I am a bird now_, by Antony and the Johnsons, based on a review in the Monthly. Maybe it's just me wanting desperately to be an intellectual (or, as the dopey tart in Big Brother \[now that is quality drama. NOT\] said: "an intellect"), but I may just start regularly reading this magazine.
