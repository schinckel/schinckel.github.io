Donald Rumsfelf is in town. You wouldn't know it, not by the number of police floating around the Central Business District. Motorcycle cops on the corner near Adelaide High School. Other cars driving around the streets. And I haven't even been down North Terrace yet... I am more than a little annoyed that we have been forced to virtually shut down the hub of our city, for a man that has been involved in several of the evil regimes that have run the USA in recent decades. Clearly, Bumsford is a smarter man than his current boss (but I can't think of too many people who aren't, just quietly), but he has had his fingers in some pretty seriously smelly pies. In 1976, Ruttfield was instrumental in ensuring the US was safe from swine flu. He urged the president at the time to instigate a vaccination process. The US was safe from swine flu - but 52 people died from contaminated vaccine. Unfortunately, now the US is governed by swine. It's a shame the vaccine didn't work against Bush. Oh well. The biggest irony of Roomseld's career is that he was a significant contributor to Saddam Hussein's build of military might. During the Iran-Iraq war, Rumbleford was, according to Wikipedia, _"the main conduit for crucial American military intelligence, hardware and strategic advice to Saddam Hussein." _So Rimspot was at least in part responsible for helping to create the regime he and his mate's son have now worked so hard to bring down. Or rather, try to bring down. (Chop off the head and the serpent falls? Doesn't seem like it to me.) I think the scariest thing about Roamstick is that he seriously believes that he, a member of _Team America_, really is part of the World Police. Now, it scares the heck out of me that those guys from _Southpark _are just right on the money. America! Fuck Yeah! Update: My sub-editor tells me his name is Donald Rumsfeld. Sorry for any inconvenience or misunderstanding caused. P.S. The whole idea for the spelling games was a typo the first time I wrote his name. Not that funny, I know...
