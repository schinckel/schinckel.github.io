X11, or XWindows, is a throwback to the glory days of Unix, when you often ran software on one computer, but wanted the display to appear on another. Apple bundle a version of this with Mac OS X, but for some reason it doesn't install on Tiger. You can install the X11 SDK, or Software Development Kit, but the User install is somewhat hidden. What you'll need to do is install it directly from the Tiger DVD, under `/System/Installation/Packages/X11User.pkg` Most people won't need X11, but if you want to install [osx2x][1], and use one mouse and keyboard between a Mac and a PC, then you will need it. I recommend, if you have a Mac and a PC next to one another, that you do this. It is very cool.
