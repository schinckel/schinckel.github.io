Say you find a Blogsome site, with a template you really like. You ask the author for the data, but they don't reply to you. Never fear. You can always get the data from a Template, as this data is world-readable: 

  * [http://schinckel.net/templates/index.html][1]
  * [http://schinckel.net/templates/wp-layout.css][2]
  * [http://schinckel.net/templates/post.html][3]
  * [http://schinckel.net/templates/comments.html][4]

You may need to right-click and Save As..., or view source to see them properly. Obviously, for blogs other than mine, replace _schinckel _with the relevant word... I'm working on getting this so the source of the current templates can be viewed in another web page, but there are some issues with this. The `iframe`/`object `will only display the rendered value, and CSS files don't display at all.
