I can't quite remember how I came up with the title of this blog, but I know it had something to do with "The World According to Garp", which I remembered as "Life According To Garp". I'm glad I got it wrong, because there is another site with the title [The World According To Matt][1]. I did a bit of a look, and he started it well before I started mine, so I'm going to do the honourable thing and come up with a new title. I might go by a Google Search referer I got today: Monkey Female Names According To Matt. Doesn't quite have the ring I'm after... Here's my top options: 

  * I don't like your trousers
  * Barely Respectable, Rarely Bespectacled
  * Mistaken at the top of my voice
  * hateful AND boring
  * Paint the Tiger/Carve the Swan
