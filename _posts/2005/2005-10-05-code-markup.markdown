I like to present styled code for my readers, but I'm not totally happy with my methods of getting it: SubEthaEdit's Export as XHTML is very cool, but I still have to tweak it so it looks nice. And I've got a great program for getting the XHTML version of the code Script Editor (AppleScript) is currently displaying. But, I'd like more flexibility. I want the code to be tagged with classes, like it's possible to do with the Script Editor add-on, rather than using inline styles. I've already done this for the Script Editor code, but I just need to remember to remove the inline stylesheet from the start of the generated code. Unfortunately the Script has been saved as a Run Only. I'd love to know a way to decompile one of these Scripts...apparently there isn't. I'll have to write my own. Or see if Jon is nice enough to give the Source Code. As for the SubEthaEdit part: I should be able to do it. I've learned a couple of tricks that will help.
