Wow. A month since I first posted about our new house. And the bathroom isn't yet done. Hopefully we'll finish the shower tonight, and then I'll actually be able to have my morning shower tomorrow. I cannot cope without it. This weekend we're planning to lay floorboards in the kitchen/study. At the moment it is bare joists, with dirt underneath. The boards are being delivered tomorrow morning.
