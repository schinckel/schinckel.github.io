I'm not totally happy with the standard iPod headphones. They don't prevent much noise from outside, and they tend to make my ears sore after a few hours of listening. Quite by accident, I came across a [review][1] on [Amazon.com ][2]for some Sony 'in-ear' headphones, that have silicon buds that actually seal quite well in the ear, increasing both comfort and noise reduction. I went into Sony Central in the city, and they have them, but at $99. I'm not quite sure I'm ready to buy $100 headphones.
