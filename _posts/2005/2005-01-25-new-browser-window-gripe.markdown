`<rant>` With the advent of two 'new' features to web-browsing/internet use, the idea of hyperlinks in web pages opening up in a new window is truly evil. Tabbed browsing is a godsend to users like me, who like to have a whole series of pages open at once. Being able to have the whole shebang in one window, and just choose between them as they load is magnificent. Probably more important in terms of alteration to browsing is the development of RSS news-readers, and the saturation of RSS feeds amongst web-sites and blogs. What annoys me now, since with every news site I read being viewed initially in NewsFire, and then in Camino if I want to read more, (I wish they would all have full text feeds, though!), I only ever look at one item at a time in Camino. That is, I don't look at front pages of news sites. So when I click on a link, I want the page I'm viewing to be replaced by the link I'm clicking on. If I didn't, I'd Command-Click on the link, and open it in a background tab. Yet some sites: such as MacDailyNews, and others, still insist on off-site links opening in a new window. And when I click on one of these links, I have to close the window it opened in, and then Command-Click on the link again. It's really starting to annoy me! `</rant>` 

Maybe I'll just remove these sites from my feeds list...which is getting too long, anyway!
