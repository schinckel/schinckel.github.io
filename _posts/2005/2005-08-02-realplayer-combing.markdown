The BBC has a wide range of programmes available in their archives, largely in RealPlayer format.  I have written 'realdump', which will grab the data from one of these streams, and dump it to a WAV or AIFF file.

Firstly, I'd like to be able to dump it to MP3 or AAC, rather than have to convert them myself.

Secondly, I'd like to be able to grab any of the meta-data that comes with the track.

Thirdly, I'd like to make a script that combs through a site, grabbing all of the data. 

Good to see, the <a href="http://abc.net.au">ABC</a> has some <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/services/podcasting.htm">PodCasts</a>, but not all of the types of programs I'm likely to want.  Radio National seems to be doing a fair bit of it though.

Update: <a href="http://www.audiocoding.com/">http://www.audiocoding.com/</a> has a CLI AAC encoder.
