I've come across a couple of issues with Gravatars recently: they don't always show.  And the weird bit is if I play around with the `&size=xx` part, different gravatars work.  And the ones that did display no longer do...

Strange.  And it's not limited to my site, either, I noticed it on the Official Gravatar Forums.  I assume that means it might be fixed soon.

**Edit:** That's crap.  The images in the bottom two pairs used to have one that worked, now they both appear grey!

**Edit 2: **Now _both_ of the middle ones, and one of the bottom ones are all working!
