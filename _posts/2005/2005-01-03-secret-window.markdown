We watched ["Secret Window"][2] the other day - Jaq has a thing about Johnny Depp. Jason had said somehting about it not really being that good, and I didn't agree with him, until the very end. I just didn't care if he killed his wife or not. In fact, I was kind of hoping he would. You just didn't get the chance to care enough about her as a character, and in fact you didn't like her much, so too bad if she carked it.
