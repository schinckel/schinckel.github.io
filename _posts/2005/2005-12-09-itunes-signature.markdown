[Paul's Time Sink | iTunes Signature][1] This is kinda cool. It generates a nice little file that is a conglomeration of the music you typically listen to. I set it so it didn't choose tracks from the same artist or album, and found some nice stuff: 

Tim Rogers • You've Been So Good To Me So Far

No surprises here - one of my favourite songs. 

Paul Kelly • Look So Fine, Feel So Low

This one raised an eyebrow. Great song, but not the PK song I'd choose as my favourite. 

3 Different versions of Pachelbel's Canon, by different orchestras

Gymnopédie No. 1 • Satie (Composer): A fabulous tune!

Mel C & Left Eye • Never Be The Same: the song that outed Mel C, or something like that. An alltime great Lesbo song.

Two Antonio Carlos Jobim songs, but only one of them performed by him: Quiet Nights (Corçovado), and Inütil Paisagem (Useless Landscape). 

Hanson • MMMBop 

This was not all of the tracks, but a pretty good selection, nonetheless. You can [hear my signature here][2].
