I'm not sure if this is new for version 5 of iTunes, but I hated how if I listened to an album where the tracks are supposed to be played together, like most of the tracks on Ministry of Sound Chillout Sessions 4, there was a gap between tracks. When, like after Disc 2, Track 18: De Nuit • All That Mattered, and leading into track 19: 2 Heads • Out of the City, it should be unnoticeable when one track ends and the other begins. Solution: set up iTunes âžž Preferencesâ€¦ (âŒ˜,) Playback as shown below: ![][1]
