I am all for recycling. Anyone who knows me knows I am (mostly) green. And I am a big supporter of anything that will increase the recycling done by our society. Schools are a great place to start - if we can have the younger people recycling automatically, then hopefully some, most or even all of them will continue do so. Perhaps some of them will influence their employer and they will be more open to recycling and reuse. So, in principle, I should support the competition that is run by SITA. But there is one thing that concerns me. The winning schools are those that _collect the most_ recycling waste. Isn't it likely that schools that already have policies in-place to _reduce use_ will have less waste? So we are rewarding those schools that not only recycle, but _use more_ in the first place. I'm not sure how it should be run, but I think someone needs to have a long hard think about this.
