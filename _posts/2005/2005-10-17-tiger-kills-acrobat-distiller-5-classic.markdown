Since upgrading to Tiger, Jaq obviously hadn't done any creating PDFs in Distiller. It still uses Classic, and Tiger upgrades stop it from actually producing the PDF files. However, there is a solution: open up **Distiller**, and change the _Job Options.._. settings for all of the profiles, so that _Fast Web Vie_w, and _Embed Thumbnails_ are both unchecked. Bingo, works again.
