Drunken Batman has an interesting post about the failures of trackbacks, and how he is going to remove them from his site in the near future.

He actually makes an interesting point at one stage in the post:

> I did put the trackbacks over the comments for a reason, and preferred them over the comments for a reason. In a small way, trackback encouraged people to do their own site, because, well, they had to have one in order to trackback and have their stuff right there front and center and maybe get some hits from it.

I found this quite amusing, especially after <a href="http://schinckel.net/2005/03/23/how-accurate-is-history/#comment-101">this comment</a> I received some time ago:

> Blogs have polluted the web. Now, every time I search for a topic, most of the links send me to blogs. I want real information, not some blogger's thoughts on the matter. How boring.</blockquote>

The irony of this comment is that I originally started a blog so I can post the sort of information I had searched for, and struggled to find initially, and then worked out for myself.  My "thoughts on the matter" are indeed egotistical, but I'm like that.  People as good as me usually are.)
