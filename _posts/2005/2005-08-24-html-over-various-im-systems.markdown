I started out using AIM via .Mac, as that is the default (only?) system for iChat. When I downloaded Adium, I discovered that you can have HTML in your chats. I don't know (care?) how other clients handle that: but I did find out something just now. Apparently MSN and Yahoo IM don't handle HTML in messages too well. Jabber (via Google Talk) does this just fine. I may have to code into the `/itunes` script a check for what account type, and only HTMLify those connections which can handle it.
