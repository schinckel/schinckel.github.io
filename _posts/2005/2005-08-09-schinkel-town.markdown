I'm surprised I've never come across this before. There is a town in Germany, about 200km from _Hanover_, called _Schinkel_. (Note the missing 'c') It's just out of _OsnabrÃ¼ck_ (less than 4km), and quite near the Hotel Westerkamp, and there seems to be a significant cemetary right nearby. Oh, hang on a bit, there's also a Schinkel in _Schleswig-Holstein_, about 50km North-West of Hamburg. And another one, just a short hop across the river, in _Land Niedersachsen_. Finally, there's also _Schinkel-Ã¼ber-Kiel_, right up on the northern edge of Germany. Just over _Kiel_, incidentally. As an aside, I found the following: 

> What does the Schinkel name mean? German (mainly North German) and Dutch: variant of Schenkel What does the Schenkel name mean? Last Name: Schenkel German, Dutch, and Jewish (Ashkenazic): nickname for someone with long or otherwise notable legs, from Middle High German schenkel, Middle Dutch schenkel, schinkel 'thigh', 'lower leg', German Schenkel 'thigh'. 

The irony is I have short legs...
