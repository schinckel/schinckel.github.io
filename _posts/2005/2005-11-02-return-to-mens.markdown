Well, first game back in Men's A Grade, and a fair start it was too. Playing with a about 4-5 guys I've coached, and two I've actually played with, along with a whole host of new guys (including one playing his first game!), it was, as always, a little slow to start. New teams generally tak e while to iron out all of the bugs. About level with Diamontec at half time, we drew away from them in the second half. Lacking fitness, I had to rely on skill (that's a dangerous choice!), and managed to post home a couple of touchdowns myself. The last of which was really only because Paul and Hully wrapped around me, but the nice little fake settled it. The nicest thing is that after a 6-2 victory, we are top of the ladder! No Dumps next week, at 6:15. Should be a bit more challenging, I'd say...
