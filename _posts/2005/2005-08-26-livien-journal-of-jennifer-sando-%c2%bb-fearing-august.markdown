[Livien - Journal of Jennifer Sando Â» Fearing August][1]

> This weekend, I am going to see _La Boheme_. I haven't been to see an opera in more than 5 years now - the last time was when I lived in Brisbane and it was _La Traviata_. I went with my family and we were all dressed up 'to the nines'. (Geez, I hate using over-done phrases like the one you just read - but my friend said it to me earlier and now it's just stuck there). I remember being stunned that the Queenslanders tended to see it more as a casual occasion.

I recall the first time I went to Queensland on a holiday being surprised at the patrons in the Casino not wearing 'nice' clothes. That is, they were in shorts, tee-shirts and thongs. This _was_ in the Gold Coast though...
