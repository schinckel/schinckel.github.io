I received the strangest Spam today. Gmail didn't flag it as Spam, but that's because there isn't much to it:

No web addresses, one email. I think maybe this Spammer had a problem... The two IP addresses listed as the first sources, those `Received:` headers that appear first, are both Private Range IP addresses, but the _m1.dnsix.com_ one seems like the service provider. Oh well, no biggie.
