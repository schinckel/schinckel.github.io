I got a phone call from a guy from TransAdelaide, or the Adelaide Metro, or something like that yesterday. I won the weekly draw, or monthly draw, or whatever; and won 2 tickets to paradise either the MotoCross or Monster Trucks at the Adelaide Entertainment Center mid August. Now, neither of these really appeal to me, but I'll go anyway - I guess the fans expect me to... So, according to the email I received from them "YOU ARE THE WINNER!". Luckily I was expecting it, otherwise I would have likely dumped it, since it looks an awful lot like a heap of the SPAM I've been getting lately.
