One thing is missing from my Comment Preview script: when you click on the link button you get a window to enter the link URI, I need to implement the equivalent for the acronym/abbr. Actually, I can probably autofill most of the acronyms. That would be cool. And maybe get the code added back into the one that is used for the WordPress Dash.
