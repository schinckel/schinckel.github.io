Done! iTunes AutoRater runs in the background, monitoring the currently playing song in iTunes. When the song changes, it up- or down-rates it according to how long the song played for. What I will(may?) do is merge this code with that for iTunesRater, so that you can rate songs, and it will also Auto-Rate them. Maybe I won't do this, since these two are separate tasks. I wonder if the current ratings are a little aggressive: -5/+10 seems like a big change. I'll take feedback, and in a future version (perhaps I'll make this a preferences panel, where you can choose the maximum rating changes. Anyway, version 0.1 is [available][1]. Caveat User! (Back up your iTunes Library regularly!)
