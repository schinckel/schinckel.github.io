I use Gmail as a repository for all of my email, and a place to look at mail when I'm away from my primary computer. I really like the Spam filter - it generally picks up most spam, but not too many false positives. Until today. An update from adsense-support@google.com was flagged as Spam. Made me laugh. Oh, and I still have 49 Gmail invites left. Email [matt.schinckel@gmail.com ][1]if you want one.
