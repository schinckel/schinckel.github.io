Apple Matters has a <a href="http://applematters.com/index.php/section/comments/what_os_x_could_learn_from_windows/">story</a> about what MacOS should 'borrow' from Windows.  I'll address them as I see the issue.

<ol><li>Compatible control keys.  These should be called Modifier Keys, and I think Apple does a better job.  Control-C is used by every variety of Unix ever for sending a break: I'd like to see this remain.  And Command is in a better position for reaching with one hand to get all of the keys.  Try to do a Ctrl-T, and then a Cmd-T.  Plus, I can use my thumb for the Command key, meaning I can continue to use the correct finger.  Cmd-Q, versus Ctrl-Q.</li><li>Save buttons on toolbars.  I rarely use the Save Menu, let alone the Print toolbar button.  Cmd-S always saves.  The only time I use buttons is if I don't know the keyboard shortcut.Multi-button mouse.  Every multi-button USB mouse I have ever tried worked first time.  Even those that needed a driver for Windows.  Like the wireless one that came with my Dell.  Trying to use this with another computer without the software installed was hopeless - I had to use the Apple mouse instead.  But yes, I'd like to see an Apple styled multi-button mouse.</li><li>Only show relevant file types in open and save dialogs.  I actually hate that Windows never shows all of the files it can see - Word sticks to only showing Word documents and not Plain Text files by default.  And, every time a beginner uses Windows, and uses Excel for the first time instead of Word, they think they've lost all of their files.  And freak out.</li><li>Sort folders on top of directory listings.  I'd be surprised there isn't a hidden setting using defaults for this one.  Yes, I agree.</li><li>More context sensitive help.  Actually, my take on this is get rid of the stupid help key on the keyboard.  I've hit this more times than I care to remember when I go to hit Delete.  And then Help opens up, telling me stuff I already knew, and not deleting what I wanted to delete.</li></ol>Overall, I disagree with just about everything said in the article.
