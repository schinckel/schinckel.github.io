I think my simple catchpa is working quite well. I've only had one comment through that was Spam, and that was actually a trackback, not a comment. Ditto for comments in moderation. However, I haven't had too many 'real' comments in the last few days, either. I hope there aren't people who are trying to comment but cannot. I don't think so, since I seem to be able to comment fine, from IE and Firefox. Love to hear from anyone using this method.
