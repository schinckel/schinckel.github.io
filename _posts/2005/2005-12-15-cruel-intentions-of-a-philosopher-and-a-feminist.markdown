Reading Maria Tumarkin's review of Hazel Rowley's book _TÃ¨te-Ã¢-tÃ¨te_, a 'biography' of Philosopher Jean Paul Sartre and Feminist Simone de Beauvoir's relationship, kept reminding me, on some level, of the relationship between the two step-sibling protagonists in the 1999 film _Cruel Intentions_. Fascinated more by the power inherent in a sexual relationship than the act itself - apparently Sartre wasn't that into sex - both couples were often competing for the affections of an often younger, more vulnerable female. The key thing that twigged me to this similarity was the fact that Sartre apparently couldn't wait to finish the job, and get in touch with de Beauvoir and let her know he'd achieved a successful seduction, and de Beauvoir, in the relationships she initiated with other women saw her taking a much more aggressive rÃ´le. Similar here to the extremely erotic "practice" kiss Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) helped the much younger target Cecile (Selma Blair) "learn". The ending wasn't quite the same - Sartre and de Beauvoir seemed more than happy to continue their work indefinitely, wheras Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe) fall for one of his victims, Annette (Reese Witherspoon), and ultimately died as a good person, who had finally, genuinely felt true love. However, the feel of the relationship between them is similar - Sartre and de Beauvoir apparently stopped "sleeping together", and their relationship was based purely on sharing partners, wheras Kathryn and Sebastian never slept together, and had a lot of sexual tension between them that was never consumated. Similar, but different.
