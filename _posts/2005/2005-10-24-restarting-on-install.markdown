> Click Restart to finish installing the software.

Why the hell do installers still insist on me restarting my computer after I install some software. I want to shut down, as it's 11:30 at night, and I don't want to have to wait for it to start up. Yet, when I installed the latest update to Missing Sync, it tried to force me to restart. Doesn't it realise that at shut down is like a restart with a rest in between? Fuck crappy installer software... I'm going to bed. Thank god for _Force Quit_. • Oh, and while I'm ranting: Fuck Opera for thinking that having a custom menu appear when you double-click on some text is a good idea. Nothing ever did that before. How is a user supposed to know that? How am I supposed to be able to override this so I can have my own action happening on a double-click? It makes little sense for me to limit a user to my auto-select on a single-click, as they may not want all of my code at once. However, the only way for me (other than to implement a link or button that can be clicked on) to allow for auto-select is by double-click. Which doesn't work on Opera. I hope they go out of business. Just for this. Bastards. Which reminds me of the old "Bastards Incorporated." sketches on the Comedy Company. Ahh, funny 1980s Aussie Sketch Comedy. "Guddayandhowareyoutoday?" • Oh, and OmniWeb doesn't play like the other browsers, it won't run all of my nice toolbox scripts. Yet. Oh, yes it does - I just hadn't logged in. Fuck being tired.
