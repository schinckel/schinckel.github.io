I regularly check my Referers list in the WP backend - it's interesting to see who has visited my site, or rather, where they came from. I really like a couple of features - especially how it points out Google referers. It struck me as a useful way to see how my site ranks in terms of Google searches. A couple of terms return a page from my site as the first hit. For example: [Google: probability of our existence][1] This in itself is interesting - and it's accurate. The post in question is about the Probability of our Existence. But more interesting is what people have searched on, found my site and visited about, where the topic is not quite right. To increase user satisfaction, I could write posts about what they were searching for initially. For example: 

  * How to rate song with itunes
  * Old postsecret posts
  * Easiest way to resize pictures
  * 1 itunes library for multiple users
  * resizing the length of songs in itunes

The thing I think is most interesting is that most of my hits come from searches for sudoku - and I only ever wrote one post on it! (And it doesn't really tell how to solve them...but details how I wrote a program to solve them.)
