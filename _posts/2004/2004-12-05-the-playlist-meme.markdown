From [The Tao of Mac][1], my next 10 tracks randomly from iTunes. 

>   1. Open up the music player on your computer.
>   2. Set it to play your entire music collection.
>   3. Hit the "shuffle" command.
>   4. Tell us the title of the next ten songs that show up (with their musicians), no matter how embarrassing. That's right, no skipping that Carpenters tune that will totally destroy your hip credibility. It's time for total musical honesty. You can put the list in the comment thread, or write it up in your blog or journal and then post a link in the comments.
>   5. If you get the same artist twice, you may skip the second (or third, or etc.) occurances. You don?t have to, but since randomness could mean you end up with a list of ten song with five artists, you can if you'd like.

  1. Enchanted Farm / Forbidden Five / **Ultra-Lounge, Vol. 11: Organs In Orbit**
  2. Tonight (King Britt's Sexy Mix) / H-Foundation / **The Chillout Session Summer Collection 2004**
  3. Desafinado / George Michael / **Ladies & Gentlemen : The Best Of George Michael**
  4. Ocean Beach / Talbot And White / **United States Of Mind**
  5. Opus 40 / Mercury Rev / **Deserter's Songs**
  6. Cruel Summer / Bananarama / **Bananarama**
  7. The Tower Of Learning / Rufus Wainwright / **Poses**
  8. Peer Gynt Suite No. 1 op. 46 In der Halle des BergkÃ¶nigs / Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra / **Karajan Festival**
  9. Sunday 8pm / Faithless / **Sunday 8pm**
  10. Double Violin Concerto in D Minor, BWV 1043: II. Largo ma non tanto / Bach (Composer) / Unknown
  11. Dub Be Good To Me / Beats International / **The Mix**
