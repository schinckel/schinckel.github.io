Ain't technology wonderful. Listening to _iTunes_ tonight, I noticed that the song _Darling Nikki_ has a little bit at the end that is backwards. Grabbing this and reversing it in _Sound Studio_ (but it wouldn't play in SS, had to re-save it and load it in _QuickTime Player_), it gives the following: 

> Hello. / How are you? / I'm fine, 'cause I know the Lord is coming soon. / Coming, coming soon. / Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha....

Reminded me of the segment that [John Safran][1] had on [Music Jamboree][2] a few years back. Way back in 2002, according to the website.
