I found a heap of Palm _TEXt REAd_ documents, but I don't like the way they appear as (Doc) in [PalmReader][1]. So I wrote a [script][2] to convert them to [PML][3], the format used by [DropBook][4] to make _PNRd PPrs_ documents.

Basically, I found that on OS X the translation of [txt2pdbdoc][5] -d (decode back into text) wasn't so good; a heap of characters needed to be changed.

I did have them all listed here, but if I edit them, ecto fucks up the encoding!

I also changed the `===` to an 80% horizontal line.

The `[[[ - ]]]` blocks were indented, and a footer line `[* <Text>]` is indented also.

I assumed the only use of a `/` was for italics, and `_` for underlining.

I also assume the first non-empty, non `===` line is the Title, and the Author line starts with By. I use this info to create a 'Title Page'.

The tricky bit was getting the Chapter Heading sorted, I needed to break the text into a list of strings to do this, and scan through. This slows the script down a lot, but it still works okay. I might profile it a bit and see where the slowdown is.

Anyway, here's the latest version I've uploaded: [txt2pml.py  
][2]

I plan to make a version to process [Project Gutenberg][6] texts, but that's on the back burner.
