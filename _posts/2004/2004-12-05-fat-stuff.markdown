Two items in this week's NewScientist: One that some people ''Do not respond to exercise". I think this is quite a dangerous statement - it gives people an easy out. "I did exercise, but it didn't help me". The other is also sobering - nearly half of all people who receive liposuction are fatter within a couple of months after the surgery than they were before. I'd like to see some follow-up data from Extreme Makeover!
