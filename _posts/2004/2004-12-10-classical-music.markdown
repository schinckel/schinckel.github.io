I've listened to ABC Classic FM almost exclusively for a year or two now, and it struck me the other day how much classical music the average young person is exposed to. Surprisingly much, but most of it is film scores. I challenge a week to go by without hearing some 'classcal' music. If we count The Simpsons theme, I'd change that challenge to a day!
