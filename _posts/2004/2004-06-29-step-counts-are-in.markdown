Well, my four week stint of wearing a pedometer is over. I must say, I really enjoyed it, and it shows me I am not only quite active during the week, but pretty damn inactive over the weekends - unless I have Touch on. And even then, coaching means I walk a hell of a lot less than playing. But I guess I don't really need a pedometer to tell me that! My highest step count was 20,022 steps: this was on a Thursday (when I play Touch) - I ran out of money and bus ticket, and had to walk home! My lowest step count was 1,415 steps - the Sunday after a 21st. You figure out why. My average over the whole month was 11,709 steps per day - more than the target of 10,000. My weekday average was 13,662; on the weekends (including public holidays) I averaged 7500. Over the whole time period, I did about 328,000 steps: the equivalent of walking to Kingston, S.E. Shame I didn't make it to [Robe][1]. [![][2]][2] Click on the image above to see a breakdown of my daily step counts.
