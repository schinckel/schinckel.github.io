I guess I forgot to blog about my new nephew, since it all happened so fast. My sister was due to give birth at the end of August. It happened instead at the start of July. Jack Hamilton Lewis was born (8 weeks early) on July 3rd, 2004. He was a little under 5lbs. My brother in law (who is significantly larger than anyone in my family) suggested there wasn't enough room inside for him anymore. So, he was a bit early, lungs not quite ready yet, and was flown to Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. Where he stayed for a couple of weeks, before returning to Warrnambool, and then Hamilton. No-one was expecting him to be ready to go home until about his original due date, but he's home now, and doing well. Jaq & I (yes, it seems he was named after her!) raced over to Melbourne to see them, and he looks just like Dad! ![][1]
