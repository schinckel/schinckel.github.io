I went through a couple of revisions of Blog with ecto the other night. I've now added the following feature: 

  * Allows posting to multiple blogs, where the closest match to the folder name is used as the blog name.

There is a small issue - the date I set (using **set** entry_date **to** date date_stamp) doesn't seem to be respected by ecto when it posts. I'll do a bit more testing, and possibly issue a bug report. Anyway, the link for it is [Blog with ecto.scpt][1].
