I have downloaded Books, but only entered about one section of my library into the program. Entering ISBN codes is just too much fun. Now, watch out for [Delicious Library][1]. iSight barcode scanning. iPod Sync support (hopefully with PalmOS as well as iPod - I'll put in a feature request!). Finally, a chance to totally catalog all of my books. Instead of doing real work! GRIN.
