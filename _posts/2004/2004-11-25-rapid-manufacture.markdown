One of the subjects I teach at school is Computer Aided Design (& Manufacture, if the facilities allow). I've done a bit of CNC machining in my time (nothing real, mind you, but a few toy things made here and there). There is a cool [article on wired][1] about where things might go, next generation. I'd love to have one of these in my workshop, or even study at home!
