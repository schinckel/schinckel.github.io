I'm not the only person publishing their novel on a blog as they post: [Le Spirale Fantastique][1] is a novel that an Indian fellow is writing, but he's doing something a little cool - if you use a quote from his novel, and link it back to his novel, he will link that quote to your website. See if you can find my link - I've actually used the quote as part of my novel.
