I bought a Palm the other day. I remember when they were still called Palm Pilots, and I really wanted one then. I was in Officeworks, looking, as I do, through the 'Soiled & Damaged' section. I got some half-price DVD+R discs the other day, just because someone had opened the packet and used one. Anyway, I digress. There was a Palm Zire 21 for sale at about 33% off, and I just couldn't resist. I went home and checked that it would sync well with iCal and Address Book, and became aware of the 'Mobile Phone' issue (apparently data loss can occur when a nearby phone rings), but decided to buy it anyway. I'm pretty keen to do some developing on it - I've got Python on there, but I want to code a nice database front-end for all of my Touch stuff, that interacts with the Address Book details, and another for Roll marking and Marks Book keeping at school. So, I'm currently funnelling a whole lot of stuff, and will spend a bit of the next holidays coding, I hope.
