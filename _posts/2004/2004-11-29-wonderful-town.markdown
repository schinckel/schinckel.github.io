Jaq bought me a book while she was in New York: "Wonderful Town: New York stories from The New Yorker." It reminds me more than a little of stories by O Henry. Just the feeling of the stories - they feel like the always awake city, even though they are generations apart. I've never read the New Yorker, although I may start in the near future, so all of the tales are new work to me. (Sidetrack: I used to think the road signs saying "NEW WORK" said "NEW YORK" when I was about 4. My sister had taught me to read, and I guess I wasn't perfect at it yet!) The foreword was illustrative - I almost enjoy reading what authors & editors say after they've written the books more than I like the books themselves. David Remnick, the editor of this volume & the magazine, obviously loves the city as much as the authors who follow him. New York (so good they named it twice - just like Wagga Wagga!) apparently is an amazing place. For me, the biggest tragedy of the Al-Quieda attacks (which occurred months after the publication of this book) was that it may have changed the city that never sleeps. Maybe, and I suspect this, NYC will not only survive but thrive. Anyway, I'll post excerpts, reviews and the like as I read through.
