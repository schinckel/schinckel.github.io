I thought about another improvement for BwE today. It really only occurred to me when I created a new blog for nanowriwo 2004. When a new folder is created, I wonder if it is possible to add a folder action (of the same folder action script) to the created folder. This way I could just attach the script to the .Blogs folder, and then when I create special purpose blogs, I only have to create a folder on the Palm with the right name. I also wondered if I should use the "Journal Entry" feature of Agendus for blogging. Must look into this. I placed a Blogger bug report about post times not being respected by the server, but haven't heard back. At least they fixed up the timezone error. Update: I've updated the script so that when a new folder is created, a "Blog with ecto" Folder Action Script is automatically added to the sub-folder. The latest version, as always, can be found at [Blog with ecto.scpt][1]. Thought: I should also tell ecto to update the account cache, but I need to know the server details, I think.
