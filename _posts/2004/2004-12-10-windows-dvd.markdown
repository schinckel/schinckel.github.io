The school year is coming to a close. Activities week is in full swing, and with the appalling weather this morning, the planned game of Soccer was cancelled (can't have the kids getting struck by lightning, after all). I had \[spooks\] in my bag, ready to return to the library, so I thought, the kids (all 5 of them, in the end) could watch my favourite show. 

**Step 1.** Put DVD into drive. 

**Step 2.** Connect Projector to PC. 

**Step 3.** Wonder why Windows doesn't automatically start Windows Media Player. 

**Step 4.** Try second disc. Windows Media Player starts. 

**Step 5.** Wonder why video is garbled, audio is absent and WMP crashes after 30 sec of playing. 

**Step 6.** Try to install InterActual player. 

**Step 7.** Wonder why InterActual player cannot find the audio device (everything else seems to be able to). 

**Step 8.** Download newer version of Inter Actual player. 

**Step 9.** Get a slightly better error message, but be unable to fix problem due to user restrictions (and I am a Power-User) 

**Step 10.** Let the kids go on the 'net instead.
