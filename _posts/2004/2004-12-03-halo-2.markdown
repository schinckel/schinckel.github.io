I finished Halo 2 last night. The last level was pretty tough - well, the bit where you have to kill the brute with the big hammer, anyway. But it was a bit of a letdown - I was expecting Master Chief (anyone else think that's a stupid name?) to have to do some combat back on Earth at the end. I also had to drop back to easy at some point, although I'll now try to ramp up the difficulty and finish it on harder levels. 

*note:* I've turned off pingbacks to this post, as it was getting hammered today.
