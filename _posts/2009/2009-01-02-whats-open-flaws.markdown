First thing I did when looking at a new site: What'sOpen.com.au (although, I think the apostrophe isn't there in the domain name!), search for some results.

Geez, I'd be pissed if I were the first hit in the list.

It's a bit scaled, but on Safari, the first item is almost totally obscured by the header graphic.

Oops.
