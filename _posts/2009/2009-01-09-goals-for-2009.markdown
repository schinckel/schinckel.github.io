What am I hoping to achieve in the coming year?

  * Learn two new languages: at this stage it looks like it might be two of Haskell, Ruby and Icon. Probably the first two.
  * Play in the National Touch League. Over 30s, but still the highest competition in the world.
  * Finish this degree, start the next. I'm hoping to get a headstart on my Honours degree, if they'll let me.
  * Release some OS X software. I have three commercial programs in various stages of completion. I'm hoping to get one of them done and released.
  * Build a vegetable garden. Got the beds planned out - just need to make them.
  * Learn to type using a Dvorak key layout.
  * Reread SICP

I'm sure I'll think of more things than this...
