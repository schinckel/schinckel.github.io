title: Bing Boy website deployed

---


Just deployed the Bing Boy website: [www.bingboy.com.au](http://www.bingboy.com.au). This is actually something that I've been working on for a long time.

Jaq did the design, and I put together the site using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Actually, Jaq did the design for everything, right from the logo and all of the print materials, right up to the shop layout and fitout. I believe she even named some of the menu items!

So, pop along, have a look. If you live here in Adelaide, then make sure you check them out, they are super tasty. My favourite is [Pretty n Peking](http://www.bingboy.com.au/menu/pretty-n-peking). There are two stores so far, and more opening soon: [Myer Centre](http://www.bingboy.com.au/stores/myer-centre/) and [Southern Cross](http://www.bingboy.com.au/stores/southern-cross/).

In case the site has changed, here is what it looked like when deployed:
