title: Marked.app previews of jekyll site
---


Marked.app is pretty sweet. What I like most about it is that it takes about 2 minutes for my site to regenerate, so doing things like previewing a post is a bit of a pain in the arse: so I can use Marked.app to have previews every time I save.

But most of my posts are technical, and have code fragments. I'm using Liquid Templating within Jekyll (indeed, a custom highlighter that caches the files), and these were not rendered well by Marked.app. Fair enough, too, as it doesn't know anything about them.

So, I needed a way to have the ``{{ "{% highlight "}} %}`` tags handled by Albino, which in turn uses Pygments.

There are posts on the Marked.app site that talk about Jekyll, but they don't actually handle the Liquid Templating syntax. For example: [github-flavored-markdown.rb](https://github.com/alampros/Docter/blob/master/bin/github-flavored-markdown.rb)

But this one does:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1583152.js?file=jekyllmarkdown.rb"></script>

Now all I need is for TextMate to recognise that those block delimiters mean that it is source code and to highlight it as such.
