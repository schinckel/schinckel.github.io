I'm teaching Stage 2 Information Technology Studies this year (it's turning out to be a fair bit of work, but I'm quite enjoying it), and I have to come up with some project topics. The students have to do two projects, one on each of the Option Topics we will be studying. At this stage, I'm planning on Application Programming (using [python][1], and some form of GUI), and Website Programming (HTML+JavaScript). What I do need to do is think of some suitable project topics. Something that is challenging enough for Year 12, but not too difficult. I've got some ideas for Websites, as there is a bit more scope to do something cool. It's a bit easier to implement cool stuff with a more limited level of skill in HTML than it is in an application program. I also have to write some skills tasks, that assess each of these topics. I've got some good ideas here for the application programming one (give them the GUI code, and get them to make the backend, and for the other, give them some working application code, but as a series of functions, and get them to combine the functions into a full application). I'd love to be in a situation where I could teach ObjC, since I do have a Mac computer room at school, but since I don't know it that well myself, that might be a future task. I seriously wish anygui had taken off. But, even late in the game then, I wasn't really keen on how the backend interface was turning out. I came across [Dabo][2] yesterday, and that looks cool, though.
