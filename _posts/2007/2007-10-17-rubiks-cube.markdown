One of my students today had a Rubik's cube in class, and I had a bit of a fiddle with it. He told me what needed to be done for the first step, and I think I managed to do this.

I then went down to the shop and bought a cube. Almost immediately I figured out how to do the first step, which is to get the top face, and the top layer done. I also managed to get a fair way into the second layer. Then I got a little stuck.

A couple of hours later I decided to find a website with some directions:

> [How To Solve A Rubik's Cube - Step By Step Directions][1]

The first time, these instructions worked. The second time, not quite.

I know I was doing them right, but at one point they are in fact not always sufficient to complete the task.

Step 5 is the problematic one. If you have two correct, it will not always work. You in fact may need to set it up so there is only one correct side, and have that at FR.

From there, it seems to work.
