[Microsoft to blast Google for its copyright policy - Yahoo! News][1] "Companies that create no content of their own, and make money solely on the backs of other people's content, are raking in billions through advertising revenue and IPOs," says Rubin, who oversees copyright and trade secret law at Microsoft. Okay, let's examine Microsoft's record. MS-DOS 6.0: Stac successfully sued Microsoft for patent infringement regarding the compression algorithm used in DoubleSpace. Softimage: Microsoft was found guilty of software piracy last year (2001) by a French court. Windows Media Player: Microsoft used a cracked edition of Sony Sound Forge 4.5 to make the sound files for the Windows Media Player tour. And it's fairly well understood that MS don't make good stuff, they buy good stuff from other people, and make it worse... Pot. Kettle. Black.
