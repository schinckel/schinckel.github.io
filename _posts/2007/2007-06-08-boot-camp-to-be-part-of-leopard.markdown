I didn't notice this anywhere else on the net, but when I started downloading the latest Boot Camp beta, I got this response: 

> Thank you for your interest in Boot Camp and for downloading the Boot Camp Beta software. We hope you enjoy evaluating this software and appreciate your comments and suggestions. **Boot Camp is just one of many new features in Mac OS X Leopard**, the next major release of Mac OS X, due in October 2007.

The bold text is the bit that appeared new to me.
