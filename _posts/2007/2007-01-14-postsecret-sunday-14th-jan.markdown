![][1] This one gets a gig because it's funny. I wonder if they noticed? ![][2] This one gets a gig because everyone knows it's true. Except in my case, of course. ![][3] This one gets a gig because the poster didn't pay enough postage. ![][4] This one gets a gig because I'm an apostrophe nazi. Does he mean his friend has multiple wives, as it is written. Or does he really mean _friends' wives_. I mean, he could be in Utah. ![][5] This one gets a gig because we used to do the same thing, years and years ago. Our phone number was one digit different to a Hospital, and we used to have people ringing up at all hours looking for it, so we started answering with "Hello, Northern Community Hospital." But we never managed to answer like that when it was a phone call for the hospital.
