I've commented before on how people use my template conversion, and remove the attribution to myself, and more importantly to Patricia, the original person who did all of the work on the template for vanilla wordpress. What is quite funny is that they remove the tags that attribute me, but usually leave in the AdSense code. Which means anyone clicking on ads on their blog will be doing me a favour. Not that I've ever got anything from AdSense. I can't even log in, since there is a clash between my original AdSense login and my new hosted domain google account. Which they haven't fixed, last time I checked. Perhaps I should write into the code that attribution needs to be left in. I must check...
