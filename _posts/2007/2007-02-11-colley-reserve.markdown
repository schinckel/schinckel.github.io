Well, I've just come home from the most fun tournament on the [TouchSA ][1]calendar. The Colley Reserve 5-a-side tournament is down at Glenelg, and is a single day tournament that is stacks of fun. My team was a UniSA+others team, organised by Paul Rogers. We managed to remain undefeated until the Grand Final, when the hand-picked _"The Drought"_ team, with all current or ex-state and/or _Crusaders _players, beat us 3-1. We had been very strong all day, with the highest score (it's a 20-minute turnaround game) 10-0, and the best for and against record. We comfortably won the Semi-final against a team from Gawler, but struggled against _The Drought_. Thanks to all of my team for a good fun day.
