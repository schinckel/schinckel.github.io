Aargh! I've just spent ages troubleshooting SMB networking on Ubuntu, only to realise that there weren't any SMB users - which is crazy. Why not just default to having the local users match up with the SMB users. After finally getting that working, I did also get AFP sharing working. Which does appear to just use the users. Still, I need to keep SMB going, for the Windows/Xbox machines that sometimes visit my network...
