Things are strange. If I use my VMWare Fusion machine at work, then it gets it's own IP address from the DHCP server, as expected. I use Bridged mode over the AirPort connection. If I try the same at home, I don't get an IP. I'll try the other base station. I don't know if it is the router or the DHCP server, but something isn't working...
