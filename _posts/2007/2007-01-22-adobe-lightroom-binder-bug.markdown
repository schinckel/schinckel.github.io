I've found what might be a reproducible bug in Lightroom b4, but I haven't done enough investigating to pionpoint it exactly. What's going wrong is if I Export as a Binder, from my Mac, and try to import it on the PC, if it's more than a certain number of levels of depth of Shoots, the import fails. I don't know exactly how many levels, or if the problem is with the import or export. But it's annoying, as I can't just export the whole library as a binder and then import it into my existing library... instead I have to break it up into segments.
