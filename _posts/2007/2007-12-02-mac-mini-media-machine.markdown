Well, I've bit the bullet and bought a Mac Mini Core Duo to use as my media centre. The old Xbox just doesn't cut it anymore - the two things I need to be able to do are play H.264 movies, and record video from Digital TV, and it can't do either of these. I've had to purchase an eyeTV USB TV Tuner to do the latter (and I'll be returning my Miglia TVmini2, since it doesn't do what it is advertised to do - which is play Digital TV properly, or do scheduled recording properly).

The machine was ordered online via the Apple Store. I've had issues with NextByte in the past, so I was a bit loathe to purchase through them. I rang them anyway, figuring that if they had one in store, I could order it, and collect it the same day.

They didn't and said that they had about 6 on order, and there weren't any in Australia.

Now, I knew that wasn't the case, as Apple have a 24 hour shipping note on this model. So, it was "no thanks" to their offer to place an order. And I ordered online.

Within about 5 hours, my order had shipped. And, for evidence that it has been shipped, TNT have the following data about my package:

So, I'm all excited. My new machine is supposed to arrive tomorrow...
