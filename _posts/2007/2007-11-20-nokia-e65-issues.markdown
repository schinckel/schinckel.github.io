There are just a few things I don't like so much about the Nokia E65.

Firstly, and foremostly, there is a noticeable delay when doing particular actions. For instance, pressing the Address Book key and then typing a name in means you invariably miss the first couple of letters. And it only sorts by the start of the name, not text within the name.

Secondly, and at times more annoyingly, if I happen to close the slide at the same time as another action happens, like someone hanging up on the other end of the phone, it turns off.

That's right, the phone goes dead. I then need to wait (minutes, it feels like) for the phone to finish starting up again.

The camera is badly placed, too. Not that I want to do video calls, but I can't see the caller and them see me at the same time. because there is only one camera, and it is on the back.

Another annoyance is that address book entries don't have a default number by default. And it takes ages to go through (delays each time) to setup the defaults. And these don't sync properly with Apple's Address Book, so if you reset your phone (for instance, to see if you can fix the shutdown bug), you lose all of the defaults you have carefully set up.

There is no autolock. It prompts you to lock when you close the slide. You can install software to automatically lock after a period of time, but if you close the slide at the same time as when the autolock kicks in, the phone turns off.

Bluetooth appears a bit dodgy at times. Sometimes it no longer connects to my computer, and I need to restart my phone. I think it is more to do with the phone than the computer, but I'm not sure.

Battery life is crap. I didn't want to have to charge my phone every night, but if I use WiFi, then I do. If I just use Bluetooth, which I need to have for synching, then it's every second day.

Salling Clicker is awesome. I have an addon script that synchs my phone every day, and it displays incoming and outgoing caller information via Growl. It also fades my system volume, and pauses iTunes when I am on the phone. This is the sort of thing that computers should do. All of the time.
