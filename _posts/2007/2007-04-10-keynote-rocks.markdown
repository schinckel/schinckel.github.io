I've never been much of a fan of PowerPoint.  I'd used it a little at University, and then this year I actually had cause to have to use it again.  I have been teaching Stage 2 (final year of High School) Information Technology Studies, and this is a content-rich subject.  Rather than what I've been teaching in the past, which is more task-based, this actually requires me to act a little more like a teacher than a facilitator.  
  
So, I've built a few PPT presentations over the past couple of months.  Mostly it has been okay, but today I started playing with Keynote.  This is a much faster tool for creating presentations than PowerPoint, but I haven't had cause to actually use it in any way that is different to how I would use PowerPoint.  
  
There is one neato feature: export to SWF.  Which means I can still create the presentation on a Mac, and easily export it to work on either a website or a local machine, of basically any vintage.
