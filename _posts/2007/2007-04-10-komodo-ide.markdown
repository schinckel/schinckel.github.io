I've been playing with (and loving) Komodo Edit for a few days, and I'm about to try Komodo IDE. Basically, for one reason: debugging. Particularly for teaching kids how to code, I think being able to step through a program line by line, and see all of the variables and their effects would be useful. I assume that Komodo IDE can do this (it's being downloaded as we speak). I've managed to get some buttons to help with using Komodo Edit working, however there is one thing I'd love to be able to do, and that's end the currently running script if it is running before attempting to execute the next one.
