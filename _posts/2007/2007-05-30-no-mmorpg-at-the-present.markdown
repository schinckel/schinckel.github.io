Well, after (carelessly) letting my Eve-Online subscription lapse, by not putting enough cash into my VISA account, I'm without a MMORPG. I loved playing WoW when I did, although I miss it a little, I'm not really about to get back into it. I really don't know if I'll renew/reactivate Eve, since I only ever really played it a little bit. Probably wasn't getting my money's worth out of it. I may download the WoW expansion, but it's a fairly hefty 3.5GB, and then I only get a 10 day trial, with characters limited to 1XP below Level 61. If I had a really speedy connection, and limitless data transfer, then I would do it. I might see if any kids from school have downloaded it. Although, realistically, that would be the PC version, and I'm really loving OS X at the moment. Perhaps that's one reason I haven't been playing Eve much lately. No Mac version, although it does work with Cross Over Office, although not on my Dell for some reason. As soon as I get my MBP, I might give it another go.
