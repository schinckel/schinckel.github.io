Not so much a bug, more of a big omission.

With Numbers, the SpreadSheet included with the new iWork 08, you aren't able to rotate text inside a cell. I use this feature all of the time, so I can have compact columns with long titles.  


Other issues: no AppleScript support. I've looked through the bundle, and there isn't anything helpful there either. Interestingly, you cannot load up the .nib files either. Or at least, not in my version of Interface Builder, which I think is up to date.
