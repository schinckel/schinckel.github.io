Okay, I finally got around to using Pages to create a decent length document. Or rather, edit someone else's. There is a big difference, as the Word document, like all of those that seem to come out of SSABSA, was pretty badly laid out. No real use of styles, apparently. Although, in it's defense, it was tons better than the crap that comes from Design & Technology. I guess it would have to be, coming from Information Technology. You would kind of expect them to be able to use a little bit of the technology... Anyway, I used it to modify the examination, and basically rewrite it for my Stage 2 Information Technology Studies class. I was able to do some pretty cool stuff with it, and it really felt a lot quicker than using Word. Word just seems to crawl, whether on a Mac or on Windows. Whereas Pages flies along. It just has an _unusual_ interface, although said interface is standard across Keynote, and IIRC iWeb. Because I'm not sharing the document with anyone, then I didn't need to save it into any other format, although with a lot of stuff I need to give it to students, so saving it as a PDF is handy. It might be nice to automate the setup so that documents saved automatically have a PDF version (or a flash version, for Keynote presentations) generated.
