Maybe I'm just being crazy, but I'm not really finding wxPython particularly pythonic. For instance, I'm trying to make a fairly simple application that has a SplitterWindow, and I seem to have to do a whole lot of sub-classing to actually get it to work. Feels more like Java than Python. Which I'm really not keen on doing.
