I'm still in the process of deciding which is better out of Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion. I've just started playing with the beta 4 of Fusion, and I'm liking Unity over Coherence from Parallels Desktop for one reason: bringing one Windows window to front doesn't automatically bring the others. Parallels still has one cooler feature: the ability to open a Windows file in a MacOS X application. That is pretty neat. So, my mind isn't made up yet...
