I had an incident nearly two weeks ago where I injured my back at work, and when I went to the doctor, which is walking distance from work, I found a turtle. Yes, that's right, there was a ~20cm turtle just walking along the footpath. I took him into the doctor's surgery, and asked if they could try to find who he belonged to, since he was clearly a pet. I kept asking how he was going each time I went back. They didn't have any luck finding a missing owner, so I took him to work, where the Biology department said they will look after him. However, the enclosure he will be going in doesn't quite hold him, so he's staying with me. And he's taking up heaps of time. We were planning on buying and assembling some of the kitchen, but it's after lunch already, and we still haven't left the house. Oh, and he has a name now: Wilfred. Like the dog.
