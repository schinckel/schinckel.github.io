I've got a new (well, soon to be replaced, apparently!) MacBook Pro on order, and due sometime this week. I'm seriously deciding whether to move away from Google Calendar, and back to iCal with the new machine. With a laptop, which I may have with me a fair amount of the time (we'll see!), the requirement of a web-available calendar application may subside. It might also be time to reconsider Mail.app over Gmail (still using Gmail for hosting, though). There's just a few things I don't like about Gmail/Google Calendar. The main one is that I can't edit the calendar in iCal, and that occasionally when I go to edit a calendar entry I get all sorts of non-registered clicks. Kinda hard to explain, but if you've come across it, you'll now. I'm actually a bit tempted to go down the hosting route, with someone like DreamHost, and perhaps move this blog there, and run some other stuff off the same account. Including web-available calendars, which are controlled/uploaded by iCal. I think I'd like the flexibility of my own Wordpress installation, with the availability of plugins, and updates. And better XMLRPC support (I can no longer upload images via ecto to Blogsome). Not to mention my own domain working better than here.
