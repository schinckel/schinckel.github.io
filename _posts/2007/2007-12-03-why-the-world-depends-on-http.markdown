I used to be a big fan of "the right protocol for the right job" - meaning that HTTP was just right for Hypertext documents, and FTP is what you need for transferring files. That's what they are designed for, right.

Well, that was before I was behind a draconian firewall that only allows out HTTP and HTTPS.

So now, I can't download a driver for a C2100 Fuji Xerox DocuPrint printer, which I need to use for work, because they only offer the file over FTP. And because it is a system-wide block, I can't even get my local sysadmin to allow the transfer.

Stupid management.
