I've been playing around a little with proxytunnel, a little program designed for allowing you to create tunnels through an SSL (HTTPS) proxy server. The only OS X instructions I found are somewhat out of date (the program's arguments are now in a different form) and I haven't as yet had much luck with actually getting a working tunnel.
