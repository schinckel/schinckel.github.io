I've come across an interesting issue. I have a PC, which I plan to put away in a closet, and run it as a server. Since one machine I use is a PowerPC iMac, I'd like to run some AutoDesk software on the server, and access it via RDP/RDC. I have managed to get connections, but there's something weird about Architectural Desktop. I can start the app fine if I'm sitting at the machine itself, but if I try to run it over an RDC, it complains about not being licensed. This is very frustrating.
