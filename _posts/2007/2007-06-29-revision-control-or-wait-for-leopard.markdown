With my new machine, it's time to consider how I'm going to store data, and how I'm going to back it up. One thing I've wanted to do is have most of my data stored within an svn repository, so that I can have revision control on all of my documents. I'm not too sure how well this would work, since I'd have to remember to keep checking stuff in and out. Perhaps I'll wait until Leopard with Time Machine arrives. Then I should be able to have revision control on all files, automatically, each time I save. In the meantime, I've set up a folder inside my Home directory that is called .SVN, and I'll put all of my subversion repositories for my coding projects into there. Have considered having an external svn server, and might go this route. That way, I'd only be able to check changes in when at home, or over the internet. Might not be too useful, since I'm planning to spend lots of time coding in local Caf√©s, where I only have port 80 access. Perhaps I should make an ssh tunnel through port 80 at my home, so I can access my network anywhere, regardless of this restriction.
