I've just started being a beta tester for Mailplane, and it seems pretty cool. The only things I'd like to see: 

  * the ability to mark items as new from a button
  * a search bar in the toolbar

That's after a couple of hours of playing, including some time stripping out redundant features using CSS, which is kinda nice.
