Well, I've been back into WoW, including the Burning Crusade, for about a week or so now. I did the short 10-day teaser trial, but since none of my mates were on anymore, it wasn't that good. Having people you really know to quest with makes a big difference.

Having said that, I've been madly levelling another toon, a Dranei Shaman. Similar in many ways to a Druid, he can take a bit more damage without having to change into a Bear, which means he can keep casting while taking a beating. Not as much as say, a Paladin, but a bit nonetheless.

I've also respecced Ibu to feral, meaning she does a heap of DPS in cat form, and can withstand a stack of damage in Bear form. Fun stuff. Since she lives in Outland now, I've also been doing a bit of PvP, which is really fun. It's the best way to get the heart pumping, much more than just questing.
