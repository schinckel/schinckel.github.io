Not everyone uses Keynote. Some people don't even use MacOS X!

So, in preparation for me not being at my job next year, I've had to convert the dozens of presentations I created for my Stage 2 IT Studies class into PowerPoint, and since PPT doesn't always have all of the features, an SWF version as well.

And, it takes about 3 minutes to convert each one. Most of which is the progress bar at 99%.
