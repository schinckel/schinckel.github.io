That's right, it's up to around 4 weeks now, and I'm still waiting for my laptop. Getting fairly annoyed, if I say so. Still, I'm using a Dual CPU/Dual Core (therefore, 4 cores!) Mac Pro at work, with 5 Gig of RAM. Which is kinda cool. Except that trying to work from my iPod seems to be locking everything up. At least unplugging it restores everything. Looks like I won't be able to use the iPod to take the disk image of Fedora 7 home. Might have to use a real DVD-R.
