I love PostSecret. However, I'm getting close to dumping it from my feed, for one reason only. They update the blog post several times a day to add comments in. This is bad news, as each updated page causes a new addition to my RSS feed. Meaning I see several dozen “Sunday Secrets” posts each week. Only one of which is really new.
