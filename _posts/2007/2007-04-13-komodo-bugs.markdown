I've already filed, and had one of these fixed, but that's only in the next beta, so I'll write about it here, too. If you double-click an associated file in Komodo 4.0.3 that isn't one of the standard files, like a .java source code, for example, and Komodo isn't running, it will not start properly. Double-clicking it when Komodo is running loads it normally. If you have a wide text load in a clipboard, and copy it into a buffer, sometimes the buffer scrollbar doesn't go all of the way. I'll do some more testing on this tonight, but it was a bit of an annoyance. Kind of hard to explain - I need to take some screenshots, or perhaps even make a screencast.
