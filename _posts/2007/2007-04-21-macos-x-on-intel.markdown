Well, after two days of trying, I finally got OS X to install on my Dell Dimension 4600. In the end, it seems my installation DVD was slightly corrupted, enough to fail on trying to install a particular package. Which, it turned out, was the one that stops kernel panics on boot. Kinda handy. The way I got around it was to use Pacifist to unpack the package on the iMac, and copy the files across using my iPod. This was after countless reboots. I wish I'd thought of it earlier. Like yesterday morning. So, now I'm typing this from the lovely place that is OS X. I managed to get Sound working, just by changing the plug location. Only in-built AC97 sound works, but that's mainly what I've been using anyway. I had been using the PCI soundcard for TeamSpeak, but not for actual system sounds. At the worst, I can just build a cable double adaptor and leave it plugged into both locations. Networking required the download of an extension - AppleIntel8255x.kext, and that worked fine too. In the short term, I just plugged in a Firewire cable to the iMac, and used Internet Sharing to build the network. But this is better, and it even picks up the same IP address (and hostname) from my DHCP server. Graphics still isn't perfect, but I'm only a few minutes away from downloading a potential driver. In fact, it's just finished now.
