[Kosmina may pay ultimate penalty for spray - Football - Sport - smh.com.au][1] You mean they're going to execute him for yelling a the ref? I thought that's what "Ultimate Penalty" meant. 

> ADELAIDE United coach John Kosmina could be forced to watch the A-League grand final from the AFL coaches' box at Telstra Dome after again falling foul of the FFA's disciplinary watchdogs after Sunday's dramatic penalty shoot-out win over the Newcastle Jets.

Oh, that's what you mean. I love how journalists overdo it.
