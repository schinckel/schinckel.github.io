Well, I've actually felt like I outgrown Blogsome for some time. Don't get me wrong, she's been excellent to me, but there is lots of stuff I can't really do properly that I want. For instance, I have some serious javascript hackery going on to get the data I want displayed. Stuff that does find and replace on dates, for instance. It would be much nicer to have this all done in PHP on the server. But some of it is very cumbersome to do in Smarty Tags, which are all Blogsome allows. I also have stuff scattered across various servers. The scripts for this site, for instance live at http://scripts.schinckel.net, which is just a redirect to somewhere else. http://files.schinckel.net is also another redirect. So, I've considered a hosting plan. When I originally registered schinckel.net, it came with 12 months of free hosting with DreamHost (originally, it appeared to be free for life, but as soon as I realised it wasn't, I didn't bother using it), and I've looked at them for hosting this, and several other domains. From what I can understand, you can point limitless domains there, and host them all under the one account. I've read the terms and conditions, and from them I also think I can resell my hosting space. That is, I can be webmaster for other domains, and have them all under the one hosting plan. Their data limits are far more generous than other hosts I have come across, and they are also rather inexpensive. $9.95/month for monthly payments, which drops to $7.95/month if you pay 2 years in advance. I might set up one of these accounts, unless anyone knows of a better place to host. And by better, I mean cheaper, with similar data limits (ie, very large), whilst still fairly stable.
