I've received two emails from Gotalk in the past couple of days, relating to my services with them. Until the end of October, I'll have been on WildIT's $36/month (or similar) plan. This is a 265kbps plan, with 12Gb/month before shaping, although I've never really been shaped, and I've pushed down over 23Gb in a month. I also have a couple of hosting setups, although they don't deliver much traffic.

The two emails dealt with these two services. I'll include them, as they are kind of relevant. I'll address them in detail individually.

Okay, my hassles with this. I'll start with the pedantic. Why must you boldify your company name, every time you have it included?

Now that that is out of the way, it's down to business. My current WildIT plan includes at least 12Gb of data, for more than 10% less. Yet you want me to move to a plan with a much lower data allowance? Based on the evidence you have? Either you have crappy evidence, or you are fucking useless at interpreting it! I suppose you also come to the conclusion that evolution isn't real, based on evidence?

Secondly, are you expecting me to only look at this on the last day before my plan changes over to your ridiculously expensive, low data plan? How am I supposed to churn before then if I only look on the last day? Then I'd be without internet for several days, or pay you shitloads for internet.

The other letter I received is regarding hosting, and it is even worse. I'll leave out the majority of it, but know that I have four hosting accounts, all of which cost me nothing. That's right, not a dollar. Ever. No money at all changes hands regarding the four sites I have set up.

> Your new hosting internet plan from 1 October 2007, will be **gotalk** hosting. This hosting plan gives you 500MB of disc space and 10GB of data for just $19.95 per month. Excess data is charged at 8c per MB and is capped at $50.00. 

Okay, let's let the bold thing slide again. But can you seriously expect me to pay $20-$70 dollars per month for hosting? I currently pay nothing! My other site, located at a reliable, proper hosting company, costs me around $.10/day. That's $3/month, and includes a hell of a lot more services than you offer. And it's reliable, and not staffed by fuckwits, apparently.

So, gotalk (ever heard of capitals, by the way?), I won't be continuing my services with you. And don't you dare try to charge me a disconnection fee. You still owe me a month's worth of service, since I paid that in advance. But I suspect you won't be paying that back to me, will you.
