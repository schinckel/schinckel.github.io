Well, I love my MacBook Pro. Except for one little thing. If I connect to a WPA Enterprise network, and I am running on battery power, then I get a Kernel Panic. Every time, within a couple of minutes. Plugging into power means no panic, using WPA personal (at home) also means no panic. Although, apparently the lack of panic at home may be more to do with the fact I'm running an Airport Express router. I'll switch over to my other router (b-only, still WPA) and see if it panics then. Apparently, Apple is aware of the problem.
