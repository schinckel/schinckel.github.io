It's an interesting situation, this whole change of career business. I've had lots of opportunity to say to myself, or anyone who will listen, "this is the last time I will do this."

Most recently, this is the last time I will write reports. Something I have always despised, and I won't miss it one iota.

I've also had the last Year Level Meeting, last Student Free Day (those are pretty good, but), and last time I have to submit student work for moderation.

In three days, I'll have my last teaching lesson. That's a big one!

And then, at the end of next week, my last day.

Roll on, last day!
