I've got a strange issue at the moment where Mail.app only downloads one email message at a time from my Gmail POP server.

Fairly annoying.

I haven't been able to find anything on the Google about it, and I don't know if it's an issue related to Gmail, or to Mail.app. Might have to try another email client. Or another service.
