Well, Mail.app got worse. Instead of just downloading a few, then one message at a time, it then refused to download any messages. And when I went into the web interface, there were a heap of messages there.

I changed around some GMail settings, so that it forced it to download the messages again. All 500+. And I have to delete the duplicates.

(Actually, I changed the POP username to recent:email@domain, and there are 500 messages in the past 30 days. Much better than getting all of them...)

Grr.
