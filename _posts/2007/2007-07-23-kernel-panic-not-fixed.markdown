I mentioned in my blog a while ago that the latest update seems to have fixed some wireless networking issues; it appears I was a little too hasty. The Kernel Panic issue is still present, as is the inability to actually force a certificate to be trusted. The third issue, that the machine doesn't reconnect to a network properly, can be fixed by using unlockupd, which will relaunch lookupd, apparently fixing the problem. Bugger.
