I noticed an ad in my Adsense section today. At first glimpse, it looks like an advertisement from Apple for iTunes. 

> Version 7.5 Free Download The Latest Version. Just 99c a Song Fast Download - 100% Guaranteed.

Then I hovered over the ad, and noticed the link: iTunes-Classic.com. I followed the link, and came across the dirtiest, dodgiest site I have ever seen. Well, maybe not the worst, but it's pretty scummy. "Download straight to your iPod" Free, written everywhere over the site. And then when you click on a link, and go to the "Join" page: 

> 3 year Unlimited VIP Membership for only $49.95 - $11.65/year 2 Years Full & Unlimited Access for only $16.44/year 1 Year Unlimited Access for $29.88 Supercharge my Internet connection with our award winning Download Accelerator for only $14.95 and download up to 300% faster!

I've even hunted around this site further, and I suspect it is one site of many that do similar stuff, since there are domain names like: transaction-id.com secure.signupsecurity.com and so on, with product names and so on. My tip: they don't offer any services, and charge $50 to allow you to download iTunes, which is free from Apple. Their FAQ even says this, but they spin some shit about making it easier for new computer users to be parted with their money find the software they are looking for.
