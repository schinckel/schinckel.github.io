[UK pair's tickets caught behind - National - theage.com.au][1]

> ... But when they arrived in Sydney yesterday morning they were told their luggage, in which the cricket tickets were packed, was still in England and would take three days to get here.

So let me get this straight. They didn't carry their tickets in their hand luggage? That's just plain stupid! It's not like tickets are particularly bulky even! Whenever I take teams touring, they always pack all of the stuff they need for playing in their hand luggage, just in case the airline loses their checked stuff. And it's a bit harder fitting playing gear and boots into hand luggage than some tickets in a small folder. They deserve to miss the match.
