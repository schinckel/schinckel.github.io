The Santa Rosa MacBook Pros have an issue where, depending on the type of wireless access point, if you use WPA (or perhaps even WEP, although why you would even bother is beyond me), when you run on battery power you get a kernel panic. The latest firmware update seems to have fixed this issue. It also seems to have fixed the issue where my machine wouldn't automatically connect to a wireless network when waking up from sleep. Finally, the third issue I had, with not being able to permanently trust a certificate because I don't have the root certificate, also seems to be fixed. Finally, painless wireless networking.
