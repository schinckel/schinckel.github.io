If you weren't paying attention, today was a big day in terms of running Windows on a Mac. Boot Camp was upped to beta 1.3, and will be included in Leopard. VMWare Fusion went to beta 4, and Parallels was bumped to version 3. I've only finished downloading Parallels, with the single aim of getting Eve Online working with this virtualisation system. I have managed to get it working well in Boot Camp 1.2, and Cross Over Office, but couldn't get VMWare Fusion to work on my Hackintosh. I'll try with the newer version when that finishes. So, after installing Parallels 3, I've played a little bit with Eve Online. And was very disappointed. It runs, granted, after turning on DirectX, which took me a while to figure out (you have to stop the virtual machine and edit it's settings). But it's way slower than CrossOver Office, which is almost realtime. And the graphics are very screwed up. Like every progress bar having white blocks, and unless you are in full-screen mode you can't click on stuff properly, the mouse pointer just doesn't line up. It's a while away from being usable for playing Eve in any way shape or form.
