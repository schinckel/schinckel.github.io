Just had a random thought. I've set up an automated method, in ecto, to add at the bottom of a post the currently playing track in iTunes. What about the ability to do the same when commenting on a blog. Is it possible for the browser to get this info, or is that getting a little too spooky. I'm guessing that browsers have restrictions in place, just to stop this sort of stuff happening. After all, if you can get this info from a JavaScript, it's not too far to stretch grabbing the /etc/passwd file, or similar. And putting that onto a server. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea after all.
