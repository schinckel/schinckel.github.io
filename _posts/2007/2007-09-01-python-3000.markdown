Or Python3.0, as it is also known, has been released, or rather, the first alpha of it has.

It builds okay on OS X, although I'll need to download some stuff to get it to build bsddb and readline, among other things. Since I use these two modules, I'll get them at least.

There are lots of changes in python3.0, including integer division returning floats, and input() being what it should be (instead of having to use raw_input()). print has become a function, and a whole lot of other things have changed. In fact, programs are likely to not run under 3.0 without a rewrite.

I'll keep 2.5 around for a while longer, methinks. Hell, I've still got 2.3 on here, just incase.
