I'm loving [Komodo][1]. I've just discovered it, and I'm playing with the free "Edit" only version, not the full IDE. I've set up a couple of macros/commands to make coding in python easier, one which just executes the selection using [python][2], and another which saves the current file, and then executes that. This should make it possible to replace most of what I do that requires a seperate window, however, the fine-grained ability to `$ python -i Source.py` and then type in commands is missing. I might need to try to build an extension that does that - allows for active manipulation of python code within the defined namespaces. Oh, and it works with just about every language, and on all major platforms. Bonus.
