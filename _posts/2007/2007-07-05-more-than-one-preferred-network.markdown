I have noticed another slight issue with the MacBook Pro and AirPort networks. If you have networks stored in your preferred networks list, ensure that there is only one preferred network wherever you are. If there are two networks, it may not automatically connect to either. Secondly, if you are connected to a WPA Enterprise network, you may find that OS X complains about the certificate, if it has been self-signed by your network admin. You need a root certificate, and tell the OS to trust that, before you can get seamless network connections happening. This does not appear to be an issue with Windows clients.
