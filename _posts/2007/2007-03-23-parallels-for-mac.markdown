I've finally gotten access to an Intel Mac, and have installed Parallels on it. Pretty snappy, and easy to install. Currently installing AutoDesk Inventor, as that's the only PC-only (other than Eve!) program I use. Actually, running Eve in a VM would be great, as then if it crashed my system the whole machine wouldn't go down. Not that I'm sure it was Eve causing the crashes anyway...
