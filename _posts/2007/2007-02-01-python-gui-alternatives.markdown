I'm teaching Information Technology Studies to final year High School students this year, and one of the topics I am teaching is Application Programming. I'd prefer to stay away from Visual Basic if possible, and I'm re-investigating currently available GUI construction methods for python. Back in the 90s, I was involved in the anygui project, which was a lofty plan to create a GUI equivalent to the anydbm interface that python uses for accessing the most easily available database backend. I'm not talking SQL or Access, but simpler database stores like bsddbm and the like. This project never reached fruition, although we got lots of code sorted out. One of the alternatives that I find really exciting seems to be an intellectual successor to this project: [ClaroGraphics][1]. This goes even further, having the plan to be a GUI library for C, C++, python, ruby, anything. I'm not sure that it will be feature complete by the time I get to it (second term), but it most certainly looks exciting. It may be that I'm better of sticking with [EasyGUI][2], which is a non-event driven GUI system, which basically allows for dialogs and interaction using a GUI, rather than having to use text. This could be a goer, I'll have to check that out too. An alternative might be to use Eclipse, with Jython. That allows for python syntax, but cross-platform GUI Java style. I think. More research needed.
