Since I share my iTunes music, or more specifically, the music files themselves between a variety of clients, I'm not really interested in having iTunes find the artwork for me. This is mainly because the data is stored in the iTunes folder, not the MP3/AAC files themselves. So, I'd rather go through and find the artwork and add it manually. Often, this will be scanning the original CD cover, if it's in good enough condition. With the inclusion of the artwork view in the iTunes main window, this task is much, much easier. Before, I had to use some crazy AppleScripting to find the tracks missing artwork; now I just have to scroll down until I find the tracks that are missing it. And then hunt around for the CD, or google for it.
