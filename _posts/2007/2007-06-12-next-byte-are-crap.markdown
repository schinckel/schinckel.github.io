Well, my MBP still hasn't arrived. If I'd been clever, and bought it through the online Apple Store, then it would have "shipped in 2-4 days". I stupidly went through Next Byte, and it hasn't entered the store yet. It has officially been three weeks since I ordered it. If I hadn't paid a deposit, I'd cancel the fucking thing. The thing that shits me most is that they don't seem to know (or care!) when it is coming in. Surely a company would have some sort of tracking that tells them where stuff is. I'm even more peeved that Apple has updated the machines since I ordered mine. I wouldn't mind too much, in that I would have originally received the machine before the updated machines came out. But it's now ages since the update, and I still don't have even one of the old machines, let alone a Santa Rosa machine. Which, incidentally, would have cut the price I paid by about $300, if I'd waited. Even if the machine I get ends up being a Santa Rosa machine, I'll still feel cheated out of that money. On second thoughts I could almost get a Santa Rosa machine from the Apple Store, and it would only cost the same amount as me paying the remainder on my on-order machine. That way, I'd get it the next day, upgraded, and piss off Next Byte too. Perhaps I'll do that if it doesn't come tomorrow.
