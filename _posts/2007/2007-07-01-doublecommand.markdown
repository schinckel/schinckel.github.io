The first hassle I had with the MacBook Pro is to do with the keyboard. I spend a lot of time in the Terminal, and use Control sequences (^C to break, ^A to jump to start of line, etc). However, the fn key is where I expect the ctrl key to be. Luckily, [DoubleCommand][1] can change this. You can also map something useful, like Forward Delete to the extra enter key (which I hadn't even noticed existed!). Speaking of forward delete, you can also map Shift-Delete to this keystroke too.
