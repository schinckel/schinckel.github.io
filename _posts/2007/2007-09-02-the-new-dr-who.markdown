I didn't really get into the new series(es?) or Dr Who. I used to watch it as a kid, since I only had two TV channels, one of which was the ABC, and this, along with The Goodies and Monkey! were staples of my afternoon/early evening viewing. Then, later on, it was time for The A Team (which, along with Monkey!, I wasn't really allowed to watch), and the original Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers and the like.

So, I wasn't really that interested in watching Dr Who. Except apparently there is nothing else on any of the other stations at the time it is on, which is a Saturday early evening. So, in the last month, I've been tuning in. It just shows you how I don't have a social life, too.

And the episode aired last night was fantastic. Statues that are really Quantum Assassins, that turn to stone when any living creature looks at them, so they look like statues. But if you look away, then they can sneak up on you, and kill you.

And the time travel aspect was cool. Closed loops of time, effect predating time. Timey-wimey stuff.

Looks like my Saturday nights are now booked. At least 7:30 until 8:15 p.m., anyway.
