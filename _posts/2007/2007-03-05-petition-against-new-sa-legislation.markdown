I don't have the newspaper article in front of me, but I am riled up by this story. Basically, some church-type fellows have raised a petition about some "anti-religious" laws, that, apparently, "limit people's right to free speech." Now, before we get started, let me state that Australia, and South Australia do not have the same rights to free speech for citizens as the USA. Secondly, one of the arguments that is made by the preacher in the article is that it will erode moral values. What makes Christians think they have the dibs on morality anyway? Because the bible tells them so? Let's have a quote from the bible: 

> Suppose you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God hands them over to you and you take captives. And suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her and want to marry her. If this happens, you may take her to your home, where she must shave her head, cut her fingernails, and change all her clothes. Then she must remain in your home for a full month, mourning for her father and mother. After that you may marry her. 

Okay, so according to Deuteronomy 21:10-14 you can take a woman against her will. Nice. We call that rape. But it doesn't stop there: 

> Make ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants.

Hmm, it's okay to punish people for what their ancestors have done. (Isaiah 14:21) I'm really sorry, Australian Aboriginals. 

> When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.

Wait, this one's a triple-whammy. Firstly, it's okay to own slaves. Secondly, it's okay to beat slaves, as long as they don't die from it. Thirdly, if they survive for a day or two, and then die, well, that's okay too. (Exodus 21:20-21) So, how's your moral superiority looking now, Mr. ne'er-do-evil god-bothering preacher. I'd guess more people have been killed by believers than non-believers. I reckon it's we atheists who can take the moral high ground. I spit on your vile, disgusting, misogynistic, racist, slavery-supporting, hate-creating religions. Ahh, that feels better.
