Well, since I got off my arse and finally downloaded what I thought was the Burning Crusade update, but just turned out to be the original client, I've played about one hour, which got me to Level 6, and I'm fairly bored. I'm waiting for the extra 1.1G to download with the Burning Crusade content, but I don't think I see myself getting back into it. Especially as most of my guild has also given it up...
