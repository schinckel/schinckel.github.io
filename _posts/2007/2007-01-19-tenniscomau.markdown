[Tennis Australia plays with domain 'scalper' - Internet Applications Software][1]

> Tennis Australia paid a "hefty fee" to the Sydney-based group, but less than a six-figure sum, said Wood. He would not reveal the group's identity other than to say they were not sport-related.

Now this astounds me. Getting a .com.au domain name is supposed to be rather strictly enforced. That is, you are not supposed to be able to get one unless you have a registered company with the name you want as the domain. And as I understood it, you couldn't just get a similar permutation, it had to basically be your company name, and that's it. So, which domain registrar sold tennis.com.au to someone who isn't involved in sport? What grounds did they get it on?
