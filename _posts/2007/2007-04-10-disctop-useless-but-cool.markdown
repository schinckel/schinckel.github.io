How cool is this.  
  
[Disctop][1]  
  
When you insert a CD into your iMac G5/iMac Core Duo, this makes it so the disc appears "in" the desktop.  Not the icon representing the disc, but an image that looks like the disc.  It's in sync with the disc as it goes in, apparently, and looks just like the disc is actually appearing on the desktop...
