Printer sharing via the Airport Extreme Base Station is great. Once you have installed Bonjour for Windows clients too, then everyone can find the printer easily, and print to it. Except if you happen to turn off your printer, and then restart your base station. When you turn the printer back on, it won't be recognised by the base station. Unplugging the USB printer and plugging it back in fixes the issue with not being able to find it. This is kind of annoying, as we turn our printer off when it is not in use. And I often need to restart the base station (that's' the other thing. If you even add a port forwarding entry, you need to restart the stupid thing!).
