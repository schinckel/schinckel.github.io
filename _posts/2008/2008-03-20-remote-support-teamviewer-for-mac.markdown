Doing support isn't that much fun, however, at times it needs to be done. Until today, I used to have to either fire up a VMWare session, or run Darwine (or CrossOver) in order to run TeamViewer on my Mac. But today, when I went to the TeamViewer website, and they have a beta version of their client for OS X.

I haven't had the chance to use it in anger yet, I nearly had to today, but managed over the phone instead.

What I did do for the first time yesterday is use IM for work specific purposes. That was kind of fun. And the cool thing about Adium is that it keeps logs of my chat with my minion, so when I bill my boss for the time spent on the tasks, I have evidence.
