One command:

`defaults write com.elgato.eyetv “apple remote menu button behavior” -int 1`

This made my day.

Don't do what I did first, which was:

`defaults write com.elgato.eyetv “apple remote menu button behaviour” -int 1`

It still frustrates me that the world has chosen to LCD in spelling: colour and behaviour shouldn't be spelled the USA way...

  
Update: this seems to cause a crash when starting Front Row. I've had to revert to the old behaviour. Poo.
