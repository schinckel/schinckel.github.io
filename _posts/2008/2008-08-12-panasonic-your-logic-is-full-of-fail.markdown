Heard on a TV ad just now:

> Because the Olympics are filmed using Panasonic video technology, then it makes sense that you watch them on a Panasonic Plasma or LCD TV.

Clearly, someone at Panasonic can't figure out that tricky logic stuff.

"Because you shit food out of your arse, it only makes sense that to eat it you should shove it up there too!"
