My laptop hasn't been much of one lately. The screen (or perhaps the inverter) seems to be on the way out, and I lose picture from time to time. What it is outputting is fine on the external display, but it's like the backlight is on (I can change the brightness, and see the "black" of the LCD change), but noone is home.

I was tempted to take it in for repairs, but then tonight opened the lid again (I've been running with it closed), and the picture came back.

I'm thinking I might crack it open and check that the cables are all connected. I don't fancy paying $75 for some monkey to do just thatâ€¦  


Update: Apple has announced these models are eligible for free repair, even if out of warranty.
