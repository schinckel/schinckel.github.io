I'm very sick of the INFO cmdproc.c:98:show_debug_cmd() rubbish that the latest Adium release is spewing into my Console Log twice a minute.

I'm finding I'd rather leave IM off, than see it traced across my desktop.

(I use MkConsole to keep an eye on things).

**Update:** it looks like 1.3.2b1 fixes this. Yay!
