Back sometime before the year 2000, I happened across a book called "Turn of the Century", but Kurt Andersen. I remember absolutely loving it, but the coolest thing was that one of my longest friends, who had not too long previously moved interstate, had started reading it at exactly the same time. It was like our own private Oprah's Book Club, but without Oprah. So, better.

Today, I happened across a blog by Buzz Anderson, and for some reason, this reminded me of Kurt Andersen. I dunno why, you figure it out.

So, I decided I'd read the "Turn of the Century" again. Which is cool, as I can't really remember what happens in it anyway. I just remember that I loved it. But I already said that, didn't I?
