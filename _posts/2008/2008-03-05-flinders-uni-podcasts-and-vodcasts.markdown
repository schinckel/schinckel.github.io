I'm studying at Flinders Uni this year - so far it has been pretty cruisy, with a summer school subject I think I got 93% for, and lectures started proper this week. Pretty much all of the topics I am studying, and a whole lot more are available as podcasts or video streaming. You need to be logged into the FLO (Flinders Learning Online - an excellent tool, from what I've seen) to get the streaming video (I think), but the podcasts are technically available to anyone. If you know the URL, for example:

[COMP 3001, 2008 Audio Feed][1] : http://video.flinders.edu.au/podcasts/COMP3001/audio/COMP3001_2008.xml  


You should now be able to figure out the URL for any topic. Just replace the COMP3001 with your subject code, and audio with video, if you desire.  


The files are quite large, but no larger than regular podcasts.

I wasn't able to find anything on the University website(s) that prohibit me from making this information public, but it may be under copyright restrictions. So only use it if you are allowed to...
