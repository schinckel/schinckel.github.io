I'm currently sitting in my new favourite place - the Flinders Uni Tavern.

It's been a long time since I was a regular at a Uni Bar, but it looks like it will be starting again. I can sit in this place, view lectures I've missed, or even just seen, and drink beer. And do my work, while Alanis Morissette plays in a double-play.

Feels like the early 90s again. Except I have money, and a laptop.

And I plan on finishing this degree.
