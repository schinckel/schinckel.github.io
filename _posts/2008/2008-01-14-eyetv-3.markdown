Apparently, EyeTV 3 will be released today (Tuesday). I did read somewhere that this version will be a fully-fledged media centre, but maybe that's just rumour and innuendo.

I hope not. I'd love it to access and display data from iTunes, since I've painstakingly put most of my pre-EyeTV (and saved-from-EyeTV) media into iTunes.
