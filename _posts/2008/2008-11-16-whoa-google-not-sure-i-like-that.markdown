Searching for some info about iSoftPhone today, I noticed something odd in the Google results page:

  
![google-resutls-visited.png][1]

The two sites I had previously visited via Google are shown in the list, and the date I last visited.

Now, this is getting a little spooky, since this information isn't stored on my computer. The fact the links are purple is enough of a reminder for me.

Oh, and I thought of another thing. Those dates are actually wrong. I'm located "in the future" according to Google. I actually visited those sites on Nov 10.
