I have only asked on question on Stack Overflow, and I really only did that to ensure I got the Beta badge.

Most of the questions that are on there can be solved by googling other sites. I find that that is a better way of solving problems for me, rather than asking a question.

I'm not trying to say I know the answers to everything, it is just that (with Google), one doesn't need to ask that many questions. One just needs to search. And search clearly.
