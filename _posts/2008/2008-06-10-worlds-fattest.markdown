One good thing about doing benchmarking of algorithms for homework is that I have time to watch TV while I wait for code to run.

And then I see things like the World's Fattest Man, and World's Heaviest Teenager.

How the fuck does someone get to 1000 pounds. And you can't tell me that the teenager's Mother isn't to blame for him being so large.

I just couldn't see the point of living if I could not move around.
