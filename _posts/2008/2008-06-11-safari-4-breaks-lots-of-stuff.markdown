Okay, I've deleted the Safari 4 Preview.

It just breaks too many things.

Firstly, it makes my Online Learning system not display properly.

Secondly, it makes ecto not work very well. It causes it to not post, and in fact not even retrieve posts from the sever very well. And it makes data just magically vanish.

Finally, it kills the ability to edit posts in WordPress Admin area. That's right, it breaks TEXTAREA tags.

How the hell can you do that?
