A big thing is made about teaching Java, and using Object Oriented techniques. "You can only program using Object Oriented methodologies in Java."

Crap.

You can, and I have noticed it happening more, easily fudge up a procedural programming paradigm in Java.

Static methods appear as procedures and functions.

In CP2A, this is exactly what is starting to happen. Instead of building on the OO crap, stuff is being done in `public static void main(String[] args),` which is all procedural.

This is fine, but why bother teaching OO under Java first, and then this after? Just skip the middle man and start with the procedural stuff. I'd rather have done Pascal again... nah, just kidding.
