I don't like doing technical support. It is just not something that I find enjoyable at all. I don't mind fixing the occasional computer - I had a mate's PowerBook G4 for a few days the other day, and even got a bit miffed by how frustrating that was. Long story short - it seemed like the hard drive was buggered, but after replacing that (which was _very_ hard), I by chance removed and reinserted the RAM, which doesn't require a complete disassembly, and it booted fine. I then spent 40 minutes fixing my sister's laptop's internet. Which again I didn't mind, as I was the one who had left it set up to use a static IP address when i was working on getting an ad-hoc WiFi network going. It took 40 mins to fix something that if I had the machine in front of me (or even VNC), I probably could have fixed in 4.

One thing I will be doing at my job is some technical support for a specialist software package. I've listened to my boss (still sounds weird calling him that, since he's a mate of way back) and I really don't think it will be fun. I can already parrot a heap of the phrases he uses several times a day, and I'll be heading out with him to do some site visits late this week or next.

Well, I'm not the person to tell that sometimes you have to do stuff you don't really like, just to keep the money rolling in. How many years was I a teacher for again?

Whilst trying to tag this post, I realised that I don't have as much to rant and rave about since I am not a teacher. I'm not the angry young man I was. Still, this is as close to a rant as I am getting, so it's going in that pile...
