My RSS feed reader this morning was graced by a fantastic article over on a new addition to my feeds list: [Terminally Incoherent][1].

> They donâ€™t need to split it into a trilogy like Lucas did. They can do it in one movie if they can and want to. The aim is to still keep it somewhat the spirit of the Classic continuity but the Vader parts ought to be darker and more serious for obvious reasons. Make sure that R2D2, C3PO, Chewbacka and Fett family do not appear in this movie at all.

That's all of a teaser I will provide. Please, go and read it in it's full glory.[][2]
