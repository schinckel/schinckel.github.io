Channel 10 is pretty crap about how it plays House. They'll advertise a new episode, and then play two old ones instead. It really pisses me off.

Last night, however, they played the season finale of House. It was truly excellent.

With Amber about to die, they decide to 'wake her up' so that Wilson can say goodbye to her. So, she is brought back to consciousness so that she can find out she is about to die.

I wouldn't want this, or do this to my partner. Even if it means not being able to say goodbye. I think I'd rather never wake up. Jaq knows I love her, regardless of me having to say it.

If we had had a fight, then I was in a bus crash, that might make it different...
