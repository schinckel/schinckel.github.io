I have a Windows box on my desk at work now. ugh.

To make it bearable to use Visual Studio, with her three areas and a scroll mouse:

This makes it operate like OS X, where the controller that the mouse is over scrolls, rather than the active one.

If you instantly go "Yes, I know what you mean", then you'll need this.
