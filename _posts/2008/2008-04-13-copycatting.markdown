Did you ever notice that [The Gossip â€¢ Standing In The Way Of Control][1] is a ripoff of [Loverboy * Turn Me Loose][2]?

Now, these links were obtained from the iTunes Australian Store, by right-clicking on them. But they don't work for me when I try to use them to get back to those tracks...odd.
