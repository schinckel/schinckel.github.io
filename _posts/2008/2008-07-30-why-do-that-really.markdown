I have been searching for cheaper ways to buy textbooks (it's crazy to pay $120 for a text, IMHO). I've chanced across www.textbookexchange.com.au. Let's examine the workflow when trying to find a book there.

  1. Visit the site.
  2. Type in the name of the book or author.
  3. Press "Search"
  4. Be redirected to a login page.
  5. Have to type in the name again because you were redirected back to the home page, rather than your search results.

I mean, seriously. It's not that hard to keep some handle on state and redirect to the search results.

If I hadn't saved so much money buying my books this way I wouldn't use their stupid site!
