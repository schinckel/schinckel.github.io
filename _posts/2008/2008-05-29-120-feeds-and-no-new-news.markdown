I subscribe to 120+ feeds, from mostly MacOS X related sites, but a few others.

From 9am onwards today, I don't think I got a single new news item.

This is just so that people who subscribe to my feed actually get at least one new item :).

(Update: Apparently something was wrong with NetNewsWire - It just wasn't downloading anything. A restart of the application fixed it. 70 items - that's much more like it ).
