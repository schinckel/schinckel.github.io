Most monitors seem to be able to be driven at a higher resolution than it says they can. In some cases, the higher resolution gives a better picture, in other cases it doesn't.

My work just bought me a new LG W1942T, which is rated as running at 1400x900, which for a 19" monitor isn't that high. My laptop (15") does the same resolution. It's possible to run the W1942T at 1680x1050, but I really don't know if the blurriness is caused by that, or if it just isn't the best monitor available.

My boss bought a 22" LG monitor, which is rated at 1680x1050, but it does 2048x1280 quite comfortably. And I have an nice old Dell E172FP, which looks best at 1344x1074, rather than the 1280x1024 which it says it can do.
