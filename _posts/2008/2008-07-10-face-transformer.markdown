This is pretty cool. Upload an image of a face, and you can run some transforms on it to get alterations.

Try it out at [http://www.faceofthefuture.org.uk/][1]

For instance, from two pictures of me, here are some of what I may look like as an "Older" adult:

The one on the top actually looks a little bit like my grandfather, and the one on the bottom looks an awful lot like my father. But older.

Some other funny ones. Afro-Caribbean:

East and west asian:
