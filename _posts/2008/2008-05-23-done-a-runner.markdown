(While I wait for something to compile...)

Had to fill the car up with petrol this morning. Petrol prices are a touch under AU$1.60/litre, which is higher than it has ever been in Australia. It costs me about 3 hours of work to fill my car up.

Anyway, there was a bit of a line up at the servo, and another guy came out to serve. The woman in front of me did the shit that she wasn't being served first (people behind me rushed over to his till), and swore at everyone and stormed out, leaving a newspaper and some chocolate bars on the counter. Did I mention she was a bit fat? And feral?

So, she stormed out, straight into her car, which she had apparently also filled up with petrol, and drove off.

The chick behind the counter didn't really get her number properly, so I corrected her.

And scored myself a free coffee for it.

But it was worth if for the show alone.
