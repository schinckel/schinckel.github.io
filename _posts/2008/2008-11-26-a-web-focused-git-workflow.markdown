A nice post from Joe Maller about web-focused workflow, using Git.

> A web-focused Git workflow After months of looking, struggling through Git-SVN glitches and letting things roll around in my head, I’ve finally arrived at a web-focused Git workflow that’s simple, flexible and easy to use. 

From [A web-focused Git workflow][1]

I'm thinking about doing something similar with Mercurial, since that's my DVCS of choice. Most of the concepts are directly comparable, but the commands are a bit different. When I'm done, I'll write it up.

(This is more a note to self, than anything else!)
