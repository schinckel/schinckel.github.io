As a class, we have the choice of what the focus of one of my topics this semester is going to be.

I'm voting for Compiler Construction. Even though we'll be doing it in Java (ugh!), it is something I was disappointed to find wasn't otherwise offered.

If you need convincing, read [Stevey's Blog Rants: Rich Programmer Food][1].  


Now, if only I can convince the rest of the class!
