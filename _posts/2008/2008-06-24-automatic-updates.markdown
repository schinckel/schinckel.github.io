I'm about to create a small application that uses Sparkle to do updates - not to publish anything, but just to see how it works, and make sure I can. I read a couple of things before beginning. One was an argument against Sparkle, or rather, an argument for an Independent Software Update...

> ISU would allow all applications to be upgraded at once 

From [Stoneship > Thoughts on Sparkle][1]

Now, I have quite a few applications on my machine that I don't use very often. Even something like Acorn, which I use maybe once a week, right down to stacks of apps I almost never use.

Some of these get updated quite often. I don't really care to download every update on a regularly updated application, when I'm probably going to have multiple updates before I use the application again. So, I quite like that it checks for updates about as often as I use it.

Which means applications like Changes.app, which I use virtually every day, and ExpanDrive, which I use virtually every hour, are kept up to date, whilst Acorn, which I just used a couple of minutes ago for the first time for ages, are only updated infrequently.

This can be taken with a grain of salt - I don't know much about Sparkle other than it is pretty cool.
