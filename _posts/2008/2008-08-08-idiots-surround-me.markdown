I'm currently sitting in a café in King William Road, trying to get some coding done. I'm not achieving much, and there's one simple reason.

There are a pair of absolute fuckwits sitting next to me, and they haven't stopped talking for about an hour.

The guy, very gay, seems to be a drama teacher. If you are Australian, think of that show "Summer Heights High" - it's Mr G. all over. I mean seriously.

The woman apparently has something to do with the arts - I haven't been able to figure out exactly what skills she has, as whilst she's been yapping non stop she hasn't really said much of substance.

The last straw was when they were talking about some drama awards night, and she called it "wanky". I was about to lean over and explain to her about irony - she hasn't stopped wanking for about an hour!

Pretentious idiots annoy me. I'll put up with snobbiness or aloofness in people who have real skills or talent. But these people are driving me nuts. I nearly bought my headphones, I so wish I had.

Aha! She's a drama teacher too!

"It's just like Pulteney Grammar all over again!"

I've never wanted Jaq to hurry up and pick me up from the café so much!
