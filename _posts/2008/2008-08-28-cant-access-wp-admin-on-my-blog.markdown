Aargh! I don't seem to be able to get past the wp-login.php page. It keeps redirecting to there.

I am logged in, and using the correct password, but I can't get through to the admin pages.  


I can post entries via ecto, too!

**Update:** _ck_ has a fix: [http://ckon.wordpress.com/2008/07/15/fix-for-wordpress-26-cant-login/][1]
