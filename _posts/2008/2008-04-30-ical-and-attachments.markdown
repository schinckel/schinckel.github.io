I use iCal for all of my time management needs, and I mostly like it. It allows me to keep my timetable well organised, and with some of the new features, it makes it quick and easy for me to find information as well.

In a recent incarnation, iCal obtained the capability of storing attachments as well as URLs. In the past, I just used to drag a document from the Finder to the URL area, and it creates an ugly-looking but still functional link to the document. Thus, for a Tutorial, I can have the answers in a PDF document, and easily get access to it directly from iCal.

Attachments are better, as you can have more than one of them. But there is a problem. Whilst you can have a document as an attachment, if you have a document bundle, it doesn't work. You can create the attachment, but you cannot open it.

It took me some time to figure this out.

So, you can have many single-file documents as attachments, but only one bundle, as a URL.

The other issue with attachments is that they are copies. If you have an attachment, and you edit it, it doesn't edit the original file you dragged there, only the one that is stored with that calendar entry. Thus, URLs are actually more useful, as this creates a link to the original document.

If only you could have multiple URLs stored in one calendar entry or to do item.
