After my last post, I has kinda bummed when the same thing happened again. Luckily, the same process fixed it, but I really don't know why it occurred to begin with. I think the same fault was fixed by fsck, so that might have something to do with it.

Anyway, I took some snaps this time.

I wasn't able to take a shot of the initial boot screen (ironically, it caused my phone to crash. Twice).

This second one shows how the text is now overwriting the green corruption. Sorry about the blurriness, but if you look carefully you may notice that the file with the incorrect block count is pcscd.pub, or something. This appears to be the file /var/run/pcscd.run, but I don't really know what this does.
